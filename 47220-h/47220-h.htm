<h2><a name="PREFACE_OF_THE_EDITOR" id="PREFACE_OF_THE_EDITOR">PREFACE OF THE EDITOR</a></h2>


<p>At an early period of his life Samuel J. Tilden seems
to have had a sense of its importance not ordinarily felt by
youth of his age. This may be accounted for in part by the
circumstance that while barely out of his teens, both by
pen and speech, he had secured the respectful attention of
many of the leading statesmen of his generation. At school
he preserved all his composition exercises, and from that
time to the close of his life it may well be doubted if he
ever wrote a note or document of any kind of which he did
not preserve the draft or a copy. As the events with which
he had to deal came to assume, as they naturally did, increasing
importance with his years, one or more corrected
drafts were made of important papers, most, if not all, of
which were carefully preserved.</p>

<p>As what may fitly enough be termed Mr. Tilden's public
life covered more than half a century, during most of which
time he was one of the recognized leaders of one of the
great parties of the country, the public will learn without
surprise that the accumulations of social, political, and documentary
correspondence which fell into the hands of his
executors, to be measured by the ton, embraced among its
topics almost every important political question by which
this nation has been agitated since the accession of General
Andrew Jackson to the Presidency in 1829.</p>

<p>A collection of <i>Tilden's Public Writings and Speeches</i>
was published in 1885, only a year before his death, but
very little of his private correspondence appeared in that
publication.</p>

<p>The duty imposed upon his executors of looking through
such a vast collection of papers and selecting such as would
be profitable for publication has been a long and a very tedious
one. They indulge the hope, however, that the volumes
now submitted will be found to shed upon the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
our country during the latter half of the last century much
light unlikely to be reflected with equal lustre from any
other quarter. It will also, they believe, help to transmit to
posterity a juster sense than as yet generally prevails of the
majestic proportions of one of the most gifted statesmen
our country has produced.</p>

<p>Tilden may be said to have fleshed his maiden sword in
politics as a champion of President Jackson in his war
against the recharter of a United States bank of discount
and deposit. He next became somewhat more personally
conspicuous as a fervent champion of Mr. Van Buren's substitute
for the national bank, now known as the Assistant
Treasury.</p>

<p>In 1848 he led the revolt of the Democratic party in New
York State against the creation of five slave States, with their
ten slave-holding Senators, out of the Territory of Texas.
Among the immediate results of this revolt were the defeat
of General Cass, the Democratic candidate for President,
and the development of a Free-soil party, which later took
the name of the Republican, nominated and elected Abraham
Lincoln to the Presidency&mdash;synchronously with which,
and for the first time in the nation's history, the decennial
census of 1860 disclosed the fact that the political supremacy
of the nation had been transferred to the non-slave-holding
States.</p>

<p>Though averse to resisting the secession of the slave States
by flagrant war, Tilden did his best and much during the
war to prevent an irreconcilable alienation of the people
of the two sections, while at the same time building up for
himself a reputation in his profession scarcely second to
that of any other in the country; and by it, before he had
reached the fiftieth year of his age, a fortune which made
him no longer dependent upon it for his livelihood.</p>

<p>The first public use he made of this independence was
to retrieve the fortunes of the Democratic party by delivering
the city of New York from a municipal combination
which was threatening it with bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Of Tilden's many achievements as a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> servant, it
may well be doubted if there was any for which he deserves
so much honor as for his part in the overthrow of this pillaging
combination, familiarly known as the Tweed Ring,
nor any for which it seems so entirely impossible to have
then provided another equally competent leader who could
and would have given the time, incurred the expense,
and assumed the risks that Mr. Tilden did when, with no
personal advantage in view, he boldly consecrated several
of what might have been the most lucrative years of his
professional life to this desperate battle with intrenched
municipal villany.</p>

<p>The people of the State were not slow to realize that a
man with the courage, power, and resources exhibited by
Mr. Tilden in this memorable conflict was precisely the
kind of man needed by them for Governor; and while yet
wearied with the fatigue and covered with the dust of this
municipal struggle, he was constrained by his admirers to
enter the lists as a candidate against General Dix, the Republican
candidate for that office. The result was a change
of about 100,000 votes from the number by which Governor
Dix had been elected two years before, and Tilden's triumphant
election to his place.</p>

<p>Without doffing his armor, and even before his investiture
with his new robes of office, he instituted an elaborate investigation
of the canals of the State; so that he had been
but a few weeks in office before he was engaged with numerically
a far more formidable foe than the one over which
he had just triumphed, but one for which his official position
happily equipped him with far superior resources. His
triumph over the Canal Ring of the State was consequently
so short, quick, and decisive as to give him a national reputation,
and to make him, long before his term of office at
Albany expired, the inevitable candidate of his party to
succeed General Grant for the Presidency. He was unanimously
nominated by the Democratic National Convention,
held at St. Louis in 1876, on the second ballot, and was
elected by a popular majority of over 250,000. He was
then destined to receive a distinction never shared by any
President of the United States, of being an elect of the
people for that office, which, by the operation of a tribu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>nal
unknown to the Constitution, was given to another.</p>

<p>For the remaining ten years of his life Tilden's health
prevented his being wholly a candidate or wholly not a
candidate, so reluctant were his numerous friends to give
up all hope of such a restoration of health as would enable
him to resume once more the leadership of his party. In
this they were disappointed.</p>

<p>Thus for more than half a century Mr. Tilden was a
shaper and a maker of American history. What kind of
history and by what means it was made these volumes are
expected to render more clear to the world, and his fame
perhaps more enduring.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden's life, like that of Israel's second king, was,
as we have seen, a life of almost constant warfare, and of
course he was always more or less liable to be viewed by
partisan eyes and judged with only partial justice. None
of us can judge himself quite correctly until he can look
back upon his conduct after a considerable lapse of years.
So we only see a public man as he is entitled to be seen,
as Moses was permitted to see his Lord: after He had
passed. It is to be hoped that sufficient time has elapsed
since Tilden was taken from us to enable us to see by the
reflection of his life in this correspondence how lofty was
the plane of his entire public life, and how correctly he
judged his qualifications for a successful political career
when he said that his party standards were too high for the
multitude. They were too high, unquestionably, for what
is commonly understood as success in politics. It would
have been easy for him&mdash;as these pages will show&mdash;to have
been President had his ethical standards been nearer the
average of those of the parties of his time.</p>

<p>Without presuming to institute any invidious comparisons,
I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that
neither in the writings, speeches, or literary remains of
any President of the United States thus far will be found
more suggestions profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, and for the instruction of any American who
aspires to be a maker of a nation's laws or an administrator
of them, than will be found in Mr. Tilden's Writings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Speeches, and Correspondence.</p>

<p>With the permission of Messrs. Houghton &amp; Mifflin, I
have prefixed to these volumes an "Appreciation" of Mr.
Tilden by the late James Coolidge Carter, which originally
appeared in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> of October, 1892. Mr.
Carter's eminence at the American bar and forum, and his
relations, both personal and professional, with Mr. Tilden,
give value to his judgment of his deceased friend which,
both for the honor of himself and of Mr. Tilden, is entitled
to all the prominence that can be given to it in these
volumes.</p>

<h2><a name="MR_TILDEN" id="MR_TILDEN">MR. TILDEN</a><br />

AN APPRECIATION, BY JAMES C. CARTER</h2>


<p>My acquaintance with Governor Tilden began a few
years before the War of the Rebellion, and my first impressions
were not favorable to him. Completely dominated
by the combined and swelling impulse of patriotism, passion,
and aspiration under which the Republican party was
then gathering its mighty hosts, I was in no condition to
tolerate anything in the nature of opposition to the movement,
or even to appreciate the reasons upon which any
such opposition might be founded.</p>

<p>It was not until the war was over, when the passions had
subsided, when it became necessary to cultivate the arts of
peace and to restore the waste and ruin which war had
wrought, that I was inclined to extend any hospitality to
the qualities for which he was most distinguished, or to
lend any ear to his teachings. Drawn from year to year
into a nearer acquaintance with him, and having occasion,
when he came to fill stations of influence and power, to
observe the ready sagacity and easy skill with which he conceived
and carried through important measures for the redress
of errors and frauds in public administration, I became
more and more impressed with his prodigious superiority
to other men.</p>

<p>What he would have been able to accomplish had he been
permitted to assume the functions of the great office to which
the majority of his countrymen believed him to have been
elected is matter of idle conjecture only; but the list of his
achievements during the few years in which, upon a narrower
theatre, he acted a public part can hardly be matched.
Omitting from view the splendid contributions made by him
from time to time, prior to 1871, by papers and speeches
upon the principles of politics and the methods of govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>mental
administration, and taking note only of the practical
measures in the conception and execution of which he was
the leader during the five short years in which, either as a
private citizen or as public officer, he was actually engaged
in the public service, we can distinctly impute to him the
following results: In 1871 he seized the opportunity, suggested
by the disclosure and publication of the prodigious sums
drawn from the New York city treasury by way of pretended
payment of municipal debts, to endeavor to fasten upon the
principal city officials the crime, universally suspected, but
of which there was no proof, of having corruptly embezzled
to an enormous extent the moneys of the city. By a long
and patient tracing of a multitude of accounts in different
banks, he reached a series of results which, when compared,
not only disclosed but conclusively demonstrated, by competent
legal evidence, the whole scheme of fraud, the officials
engaged in it, and the amounts received by each.
Although a strict party man and chairman of the Democratic
State Committee, yet, finding that the Democratic
organization of the city of New York could not be wrested
from the control of the official delinquents, he organized
and led the popular movement which effected their overthrow.
He accepted, at the same time, a nomination for
the legislature, was elected, and extorted from a reluctant
majority the impeachment of the corrupt judges who had
disgraced the judicial ermine. In 1874, when the craze for
fiat money had become prevalent throughout a great part of
the country, and more threatening to the public prosperity
than the free-silver delusion has at any time been, he drew
from the Democratic State Convention of New York the
first condemnation which it had received from either of the
national parties. Elected in that year as Governor of the
State, he conceived an extensive series of reforms in administration,
drew the necessary legislative bills, secured
their adoption, and carried them into effect. These plans
contemplated, by the adoption of new methods and various
economies, extensive reductions in the public expenditures,
the institution of suits for the punishment of frauds of
public officers, and the recovery of moneys embezzled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
them. They had very large practical results.</p>

<p>Nor was he less efficient in baffling mischievous schemes.
The Democratic organization of Tammany Hall, reorganized,
after the overthrow of Tweed, under the leadership of
John Kelly, an able and not dishonest partisan chief, demanded
from the Democratic majority in the legislature
the passage of laws designed to secure to that organization
a more complete control of the municipal patronage. Governor
Tilden refused to lend his countenance to this policy,
and the imperious leader undertook to force him into acquiescence
by forming a combination in the legislature with
the numerous adherents and stipendiaries of what was
known as the Canal Ring. That coterie of men, powerful
in both parties, had already scented the peril to their practices
threatened by the Governor's reformatory plans, and
were only too willing to join in a warfare against him.
He suddenly found himself in danger of being deserted by
a majority of his own party. The Democratic Speaker of
the Assembly took the floor, and arraigned him as unfaithful
to the Democracy of the State. He had long before
seen the possibility of this combination against him, and
had sought by the practice of all the conciliatory arts, of
which he was a thorough master, to prevent it. When it
came, he was not daunted by it, but boldly went behind his
enemies to the constituencies which they were betraying.
They soon found that they were dealing with an adversary
who possessed resources which they had not taken into account.
Most of them abandoned their opposition. The
rest were severely dealt with by their constituents.</p>

<p>Never were the possibilities for good of a great office
like that of Governor of New York so happily developed
and displayed. In the course of an administration of
two years, an enormous reduction in taxation was effected;
the administrative system in every department was improved;
the lobby was almost dispersed; and at the same
time the Governor, in his communications with the public
through his annual messages, his veto messages, and speeches
upon official and other public occasions, was furnishing to
the people of the State, and indeed of the whole country, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
nearly complete exposition, theoretical and practical, of the
whole work of public administration. I have never read a
state paper which equals his second annual message in the
power and ease with which it treats of the principles upon
which government should be conducted, or in the order and
perspicuity with which it arranges and sets forth the details
of public business. In this paper he considers at much
length the then depressed condition of business, its causes,
and the proper remedies. It may be thought&mdash;was thought
at the time by some&mdash;that this was going beyond the domain
of state affairs in order to make an ambitious display
of knowledge upon the larger concerns of the nation; but
it would be well if every man possessing such knowledge
as is here exhibited, and such a capacity for communicating
it, would embrace all opportunities to display it. Governor
Tilden, however, had a special motive in placing his views
before the country at that time. He saw the false policy
of indefinite issues of government legal-tender currency
everywhere taking hold of the public mind, and that, unless
speedily corrected, it would acquire a force to which the
timidity of political leaders would submit. He had already
induced a convention of the Democratic party in New York
to take ground against it. He wished to draw forth a similar
declaration from the Democracy of the nation, at its
next convention for the nomination of a President. He
succeeded; and to his influence, probably, more than to that
of any other man, we owe the downfall of the paper-money
delusion.</p>

<p>An attempt to analyze the rare combination of talents
and faculties which enabled him to accomplish so much in
a period so brief may not be uninteresting. His original
intellectual endowments were of the highest order. They
were not of that character which, while leaving their possessor
satisfied with some hasty and superficial conclusions
that at the moment seem true, enable him to impress them
upon others by fervid and moving language. These are the
intellectual traits most frequently exhibited by the ablest
men whom our public life brings into notice; but they do not
make up the <i>scientific</i> mind which Governor Tilden's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>pre-eminently
was. At the beginning of his intellectual manhood
he clearly perceived that the whole moral world was
as rigidly as the physical world subject to an order, an
arrangement, a law; and that all policies, whether in government,
in finance, or in business, not founded upon a
recognition of this truth would result in confusion and mischief.
Naturally attracted to the study of the public economy
of States, his first aim was to discover the laws governing
every part of that extensive domain. Whether the theme
was expenditure, taxation, private or public justice, internal
improvements, or any form of public administration, he
would make no utterance until his brooding mind had
reached what he conceived to be the underlying truth; and
the same trait was manifest in him where the purpose was
not to refute or establish a general policy, but to ascertain,
in a particular case, the truth upon a disputed question of
fact.</p>

<p>This was well illustrated in his defence, in 1856, of the
title of Azariah C. Flagg to the office of comptroller of the
city of New York, against the claim of John S. Giles.
Flagg had been declared elected by the Board of County
Canvassers. He was a man of resolute integrity, had held
the office before this election, and, by his obstinate defence
of the city treasury against unjust and fraudulent claims,
had drawn upon himself the hatred of the municipal plunderers,
and earned from them the title of "Old Skinflint."
His enemies had made a combined and desperate effort to
defeat his re-election, and, having failed by a few votes only,
they determined, upon the pretence of an erroneous return,
to make an attempt to oust him from his office by a judicial
proceeding and install Giles in his place. For this purpose
they fixed upon the vote of the first district of the Nineteenth
Ward, the majority of the election officers of which were
bitter enemies of Flagg. Their pretence was that the return
of the district election officers giving 316 votes for
Flagg and 186 for Giles was a clerical error, by which
Giles' vote was awarded to Flagg and Flagg's vote to Giles.
Three of the election officers who signed and filed this return
were sworn as witnesses for Giles, and positively testified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
that the vote as actually counted was just the reverse
of the return; that Giles had 316 votes, and Flagg 186.
The original tally-list of the regular tickets, which would
have shown the truth, had been conveniently lost, but these
witnesses produced what they swore was the original tally-list
of the split tickets, and upon which was a pretended
transfer of the votes on regular tickets, which they swore
was correct, and this fully supported their statements. Other
witnesses on the same side testified that they were present
at the close of the counting on the day of the election, and
heard the result proclaimed, and that it gave 316 to Giles
and only 186 to Flagg. This formidable case could be
overthrown only by showing that these witnesses were perjurers,
and this pretended split tally-list a forgery. Tilden
had no doubt that this was the fact, but he had no direct
evidence to prove it. He was a determined enemy of these
base conspirators and a close friend and ardent admirer of
Flagg, and he was resolved that the fraudulent scheme
should not succeed. Acting upon the assumption that a lie
has no place in the regular order of nature, but is something
violently thrust into that order and will not fit the surrounding
and attendant facts, he laboriously endeavored to bring
into light, so far as possible, all those surrounding and attending
facts. It so happened that this election was a contest
between numerous factions, and that there were seven
regular tickets voted; that is, tickets having uniformly the
same names and for the same offices; and there were twelve
candidates for the various city offices on each ticket. There
were also many split tickets, created by erasure of one or
more names from a regular ticket, or otherwise. Here was
fruitful material for the exercise of Tilden's powers of investigation.
He demonstrated, and with mathematical certainty,
by an analysis and comparison of the actual returns
of votes for all the candidates on these tickets, that the
pretence of Giles was a pure fabrication. At the close of
his argument he threw his demonstration into a dramatic
form, which created such an impression that, as Mr. Charles
O'Connor, who was associated with Mr. Tilden, once told
me, the case of the plaintiff Giles was utterly defeated be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>fore
the defendant had called a witness. It was, of course,
difficult for the jurors to carry in their minds the numerous
figures which made up the demonstration. Something was
needed to impress upon them the result. For this Tilden
pitched upon the lost original tally-sheet of the regular vote.
It was upon the amount of Flagg's <i>regular</i> vote that the
whole controversy turned. If the contents of that lost tally
could be shown, all doubt would be dispelled. Said he, "I
propose now, gentlemen, to submit this case to a process as
certain as a geometrical demonstration. <i>I propose to evoke
from the grave that lost tally</i>; to reproduce it here, to confront
and confound these witnesses who have been upon the
stand swearing to what is not true. It is an honest ghost.
It will disturb no true man." And he did it triumphantly.
Handing to the jurors sheets containing copies of the regular
tickets, and selecting a name which was found on only one
of these tickets, that of Samuel Allen for street commissioner,
he called off from the actual return to the Board of
County Canvassers, and the jurors set down Allen's vote,
which was 215. It necessarily followed that every other
name on that ticket must have received the same number,
or the ticket would not be regular. Proceeding in the same
way with all the names on all the tickets, and then deducting
the regular vote from the whole vote as shown by the actual
return, and thus obtaining the split votes for each candidate,
and comparing these results, except as to Flagg and Giles,
with the tally-sheet of the splits which had been produced
by the witnesses for Giles, and which was presumably correct,
except in respect to the vote for Flagg and Giles, he
slowly, step by step, re-created an original tally of the regular
ticket, which, when increased by the split votes shown
on the split tally-list, corresponded in every particular with
the actual return to the county canvassers except as to three
unimportant names, and as to these it was manifest that the
actual return was erroneous. Each juror found, at the close
of the calling, that he held in his hands what he could not
but believe was an absolutely accurate count of the votes in
the first district of the Nineteenth Ward for all the candidates
voted upon, for whatever office, at the election under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
investigation. The hideous monstrosity of the figures assigned
to Flagg and Giles in the split tally-list became so
palpable that none could doubt. It is needless to add that
when the case was finally submitted to the jury they immediately
returned with a verdict for "Old Skinflint."</p>

<p>He employed a similar method in the case of
what was called the Six Million Audit fraud of Tweed
and his accomplices. That the payment of this enormous
sum was a gigantic fraud no one could doubt; but
there was no proof showing <i>how much</i> of the payments was
in excess of what was due to the claimants, or among whom
the excess was divided, and how much to one and how much
to another. Mr. Tilden unlocked this mystery. He went
to the banks in which the conspirators kept their accounts,
and by a patient decomposition of the credits into the original
items, as shown by the deposit tickets, evolved the plunderers'
rule of division. Applying this rule to any one of
the hundreds of paid city warrants embraced in this series
of frauds, and without going beyond the face of the warrant,
it could be determined how much each of the conspirators
received; and the determination would be verified by finding,
upon examining the bank accounts and deposit tickets
of the same parties, that they had received on the day of
the payment of the warrants the same sums which, according
to the rule applied, they ought to have received. It
vexed Mr. Tilden very much that the shares of the conspirators,
as thus computed, did not correspond with perfect
exactitude to the amounts deposited to their credit. The
difference, being trifling in amount, hardly affected the conclusiveness
of the demonstration; but it showed that there
was some element in the rule of division which he had not
discovered. The missing link was subsequently found, and
then the conformity between the computed and the actual
shares was in every instance exact to a penny. This division
and conformity, appearing upon the face of the accounts
themselves, proved with absolute certainty the conspiracy
to defraud, the amounts of the embezzlements, and the precise
shares received by each. Had Mr. Tilden been present
at the meetings of the conspirators and witnessed their d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>ivision
of the spoils, he could not have given evidence so conclusive
of the fraud as that which he thus drew from written
memoranda which the conspirators had thoughtlessly allowed
to be made.</p>

<p>It was indeed wonderful to observe how a man who could
study these dry details with such patience, and even with
pleasure, could pass at once into the fields of political science
and compel a wholly different class of facts to yield to him
the loftiest generalizations. But in truth the process was
the same in both instances. It was the original investigation
of facts for the purpose of framing a just theory. It
is a common practice, even with able men, to disparage the
conclusions founded upon the employment of the reasoning
powers as being <i>mere theory</i>; as if their own conclusions,
so far as they have any value, were reached in any other
way. These are the criticisms of men who are too indolent
to engage in the work of patient investigation, or not sufficiently
instructed in the methods by which it should be pursued.
Undoubtedly there are many minds that undertake
the task of evolving the laws underlying some subject matter
and reach conclusions which are confidently believed
and asserted to be true, but that turn out when adopted in
practice to be erroneous. It is in this way that the results
of investigation and reasoning are brought into discredit.
But the fault in such cases is not that the conclusions are
those of mere theory, but of erroneous theory. The reasoner
lacks the patience, or the skill, to embrace in his investigation
all the material facts, and to exclude all others. These
are, indeed, the rarest of qualities. They are possessed in
an eminent degree by a few men only in each generation,
and the value of such men to society is inestimable. Governor
Tilden's pre-eminence was especially manifest here.
His educated intelligence was able to pronounce, as if by
instinct, whether the conclusion he had reached was sufficiently
certain to be made the basis of action, or was so
encumbered with doubt as to call for further scrutiny into
the facts. He knew how&mdash;to use his own happy phrase&mdash;"to
limit theory by practice and enlighten practice by
theory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>

<p>The mere pursuit of truth, the pleasure which comes from
the actual exercise of superior powers, the sense of satisfaction
which arises from the overcoming of difficulties, would
have been a sufficient reward and stimulus to a mind like
his; but this was not his principal motive. His chief aim
was to convince others; and he knew that this could be done
only by the effective use of language. He recognized the
importance of the art of rhetoric, and labored upon the
composition of his papers with the same care which the
purely literary man employs; not for the purpose of making
up a piece of what is called fine writing, but to engage and
hold the attention by imparting life and interest to his treatment,
and, by an easy and natural development of his subject,
to carry the mind gratefully along towards his conclusions.
It would be hard to find better examples of the
way in which subjects apt to be regarded as dull may be
made lively and interesting, and yet without departing in
the slightest degree from a rigid and logical development,
than are found in his report, while a member of the legislature
of New York, upon the causes of the anti-rent disorders
and the proper remedy for them; or his speech in
the constitutional convention of that State in 1867, unfolding
the true policy to be pursued in relation to the canals;
or his second annual message when Governor in 1876. I
find, on the page at which I open a volume of his speeches
and writings, the following sentence, which well illustrates
the ease and power with which he could clothe weighty truths
in their appropriate language: "Generations, like individuals,
do not completely understand inherited wisdom until
they have reproduced it in their own experience."</p>

<p>These high intellectual traits would have made him a
man of mark had he been a philosophical recluse holding
himself aloof from the busy activities of life; but the extraordinary
thing was that he was at all times emphatically
a man of action. Whether engaged in the conduct of some
great lawsuit or of some important business enterprise, or
managing a political campaign, he was equally at home.
The schemes of small party chieftains and the power of local
bosses gave way before his masterful leadership. He di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>d
not despise the aid of partisan machinery or of official
patronage; but he fully perceived that the scope and influence
of these instrumentalities were narrow, and that, unless
held rigidly secondary and subordinate, they would obstruct,
rather than aid, the march of a political party. Profoundly
convinced of the truth of the political creed which he
avowed, he engaged in political warfare only to secure its
permanent establishment. Any victory won by shifty expedients
he knew would be but temporary, and would not
fail to retard a lasting success. At the same time he recognized
the fact that no main purpose of a political party could
ever be carried except by the permanent union of men differing
from each other upon a multitude of minor points,
and exhibiting every grade of culture, character, and conduct.
Compromise and concession be recognized as the daily
duties of the statesman. He had little regard for those impracticable
natures which refuse to join any party because
they find something to object to in all parties. He was the
last man to yield to self-conceit and obstinacy the titles of
conscience and wisdom. Such men, he once declared, forget
"that without concession there can be no common action
for a common object, and that without the capability of
such action a man is fit, not for society, not even for a state
of nature, but only for absolute solitude." I wonder that
the mugwump-haters have not borrowed his description of
some non-partisans of his day: "I know there is a class of
no-party men who vindicate their claim to that character
by doing injustice to all, even without the excuse of bias."</p>

<p>But <i>how far</i> should you carry the spirit of compromise
and concession&mdash;<i>how far</i> tolerate what you believe to be error
in order to obtain an over-balancing good? This is the
puzzle of statesmen, and indeed of every man, so far as he
undertakes any part, even though only as a private citizen,
in public concerns. There are two ways of dealing with it.
One is to shirk it by an indolent abandonment of the important
offices of social and public life. The other is to meet
it with the best solution we can find. Tilden had little regard
for the first of these methods. He accepted the second;
and with his matchless ability for drawing a line up to whi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>ch
we must, but beyond which we must not go, he would have
had little excuse for the other choice. There were several
occasions when he felt obliged to draw this line and rigidly
observe it, although the result might be immediately disastrous
to the party to which he was attached and to his
own personal ambitions. His opposition, in 1871, to Tammany
Hall, already noticed, is an instance. Occupying, as
he then did, the important post of chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, he could not step out of the
local organization in the metropolis and make war upon its
leaders without seeming disloyalty to his party, nor without
endangering its success in the next State election. But he
determined, against combined solicitations and threats, to
take this course, and the result showed the wisdom of his
choice, even as a measure of party policy. And again, when
the irredeemable paper-money delusion had to a far greater
degree than the free silver coinage craze gained possession
of the popular mind throughout the West and South, and in
the view of many ardent politicians promised a victory to
the Democratic party if that party would extend some favor
to it, he compelled from the national convention of the
party a repudiation of the heresy. No temporary advantage
which his party might gain would in his view be worth acceptance,
if purchased at the price of such a sacrifice of
fundamental principle.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that with his profound knowledge
of the causes by which human affairs were controlled,
combined with such capacities for skilful action, he should
have accumulated a large fortune. Aside from what he
received for professional services, his large gains were, I
imagine, rather easily acquired. Among the mischiefs of
an unstable currency is the facility with which men who
have the power of dealing skilfully with exceptional conditions
may amass large fortunes. Few men understood such
things better than Mr. Tilden. He had striven to prevent,
as well as a man in opposition could, the issue, during the
war, of an irredeemable government currency; but I remember
his saying to me after the policy was adopted, in substance:
"Now is the time to make yourself rich. Buy all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
that you can pay for, or run in debt for. Every day it will
be easier and easier for you to pay, and your property will
correspondingly rise in value, or rather in price." And at
the close of the war he advised the opposite course. I do not
know, but I have little doubt that he acted extensively on
this policy. If there were a question as to the propriety of
such action, he certainly was excusable. Had his counsels
been regarded, no such measure would have been adopted.</p>

<p>The malice of political opponents was wont to ascribe his
success in money-getting to schemes for obtaining interests
in the property of insolvent railway companies at less than
their value. They stigmatized him as a "railroad-wrecker."
Never was there less foundation for a charge. He was a
railroad-preserver. His skill in the management of difficult
and complicated affairs, combined with his profound knowledge
of the fundamental principles of equity, made his
services invaluable to parties interested in the property and
securities of railroad companies which by bad management,
or in consequence of over-sanguine expectations, had fallen
into difficulties. His capacious mind was just fitted for the
survey of such situations. He was among the first, if not
the first, to perceive that a ruthless attempt to foreclose a
first mortgage and thus to crush out all subordinate liens
and interests was ill-suited to such cases; that the just and
true method was to ascertain the real capacities of the business,
and to reorganize the enterprise upon a scheme which
would indulge the hope of saving to the junior securities a
large part of their supposed original value. More than
one of the great railroads of the country have, at his skilful
touch, risen from absolute bankruptcy into prosperity, and
repaid all or the larger part of the original investment.</p>

<p>With all his capacity for making sober estimates, and
escaping the illusions by which many minds are carried
away, he was yet an enthusiast, especially in respect to the
plans and enterprises which were the offspring of his own
fruitful brain. This came partly from personal vanity, of
which he had a plentiful supply, and partly from the exhilaration
which attends the exercise of high intellectual
powers and rewards the conquest of difficulties. I reme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>mber
a display of this tendency which greatly impressed me.</p>

<p>In the performance of a professional service for him while
he was Governor, in connection with a lawsuit to which he
was a party, it became necessary that I should tarry several
days at his house in Albany in order to secure his attention
during the intervals between his official duties. It was while
the St. Louis Convention was in session at which he was
nominated for the Presidency. One would suppose that
under such circumstances he could have given his mind to
little else than the business in which his personal fortunes
were so deeply concerned. But he could not have devoted
himself more ardently to recalling and arranging the facts
of the complicated transactions out of which this lawsuit
grew than he did on the very day when he was nominated.
Late in the afternoon of that day, after protracted work,
he took me upon a long drive with him. In the course of it
he did not even allude to the convention, or its doings, although
a flight of telegrams had been coming to him. His
conversation, animated and incessant, was upon false policies
in government, the mischiefs and burdens of over-expenditure,
the true principles of taxation, the errors of protective
tariffs, etc. One could see that the mere matter of holding
the Presidential office was little to him; but that the chance
of laying his reforming hand upon the multitude of abuses
with which, as he supposed, the whole administration of the
general government was infested aroused his enthusiasm,
as the prospect of a season of sport would that of a boy.
Becoming animated with his theme, eloquent and intense in
his language, he failed in attention to the high-spirited horse
he was driving, and I was in constant fear of a catastrophe.
Indeed, on a similar drive the succeeding day we met with
one from the same cause. The injury was inflicted instead
of received, and cost the Governor several thousand dollars
by way of damages. When, on our return, on the day first
mentioned, we were near home, I observed to him that he
would perhaps find at the house a telegram announcing his
nomination. "No," said he, unconcernedly, "not until
about half-past nine." It came not many moments from
that time. Impressed upon this occasion with his pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>found
and extensive knowledge of everything relating to the science
of government, and thinking his views not substantially
at variance with those held by leading Republicans&mdash;for
at that time the Republican party had not become committed
to its present dogmas on the subject of protective
tariffs&mdash;I ventured to express to him the surprise I felt that
he had not allied himself with that party; saying that it
seemed to me that, considering the greatly superior number
of men of education and public spirit to be found in its
ranks, he could much more easily procure a general acceptance
of his opinions by acting in alliance with them. He
answered that he thought that I was mistaken; that, while
it was true that a large majority of the men of culture,
wealth, and force were to be found in the Republican party,
the trouble was that, to use his language, "it was a party of
self-seekers." He explained that he did not mean this in
any offensive sense; that what he meant was that the controlling
men of that party were men of large pecuniary
interests, seeking to build up fortunes and families; that
these personal interests were so large as necessarily to engross
their thoughts and control their opinions, leading them to
use their powerful influence so as to shape the legislation of
the country in a form which would favor those interests;
that it was difficult to lead such men along the pathway of
those fundamental principles of democratic government by
which alone equal justice could be done to the masses of
men; that the Democratic party held within its ranks a far
less number of men of this description&mdash;not enough to control
its action&mdash;and consequently the opinions of its great
masses could be more easily shaped and molded by the
mere force of ideas; that this was the distinction between
the former Democratic and Whig parties, and that the Republican
party would, as the patriotic inspirations caught
from the opposition to slavery and the defence of the Union
died away, become the mere successor to the spirit and policy
of the Whig party.</p>

<p>"These observations, as applied to the two present
parties of the country, would not, probably, be accepted
without dissent; but they intimate a most importan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>t
truth. This is that when a man comes to be the possessor
of large property interests, these will, whatever may
be his character, control his opinions in relation to any
question affecting them. The great railroad interests of the
country are conducted by men, I suppose, of as honorable
character as can be found in any walk of life; but they will
not, in the face of threatened disaster, keep the agreements
they make with each other. They do not hesitate, when
these interests are threatened by adverse legislation, to defend
them by secret arts and practices&mdash;kept secret because
they could not be avowed without a blush. Mr. Jay Gould,
in some testimony drawn from him by a legislative committee,
expressed the truth by saying that he was "sometimes
a Democrat and sometimes a Republican, but always
an Erie man." It must be admitted that the occasions are
often fearfully trying. They sometimes impose a test which
human nature is ill-fitted to bear. The individual who
is subjected to them is called upon to defend, not only his
own property, but that of others. A man may surrender
his own interests, but what account is he to give of himself
when he surrenders interests which have been intrusted to
him for defence?</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that Governor Tilden possessed,
on the whole, greater capabilities for usefulness in public
life than any other man of his generation. I cannot find
elsewhere such a union of the ability to discover true governmental
policies with the firm and undeviating purpose
to pursue them. This is not the universal estimate of him.
A certain measure of distrust seems to have accompanied
the general admiration of his talents. For this there never
was any just foundation. I do not think any public man of
his time was more faithful to his conceptions of truth.
No impartial man could now well doubt this after going
over the record of his services and reading his speeches and
public papers. Indeed, it is hardly possible that so ardent
a searcher after scientific truth could be otherwise than
faithful to it. We can scarcely imagine Socrates and Newton
to have been dishonest men. That Lord Bacon fell
excites our wonder. And yet there must always be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
ground for any widely extended impression. I think that
in this instance the cause is manifest. His pre-eminence
was in the intellectual rather than in the emotional powers.
In order to achieve his purposes he preferred to appeal
to the intellect rather than to the heart. Plain, blunt
honesty is universally perceived and understood, and is
admired and confided in, even when it blunders. But common
men have so often been deceived by the sharp practices
of those who are a little brighter than themselves, that they
are apt to distrust intellectual superiority, and half suspect
it to be a species of cunning. The malice of personal and
party hostility, working upon this natural tendency, has
found an easy acceptance of its calumnies.</p>

<p>But, beside this, Governor Tilden was a practical leader
in affairs, both of business and politics; and although he
was all openness and candor in his public discussions, yet
in his methods of action he could not, any more than other
men, dispense with secrecy and reserve; and as he was apt
to excel others in whatever methods he adopted, he perhaps
excelled them in secretiveness as well. A good share
of another quality which does not tend to secure admiration
for the possessor fell to Mr. Tilden. It was not unnatural
that a man so conscious of superior powers should be somewhat
vain. Men do not like to have "I told you so" flung
into their ears at every turn in the course of events, and
Mr. Tilden had a habit of doing this.</p>

<p>But he was by no means wanting in the sense of moral
earnestness, and he had a just perception of the occasions
demanding the exercise of that faculty. He was well aware
that fraud and corruption could not be successfully combated
with the weapons of reason, and that they did not
deserve to be reasoned with. When he found himself confronted
by the powerful Canal Ring, which had fattened for
a generation upon fraudulent contracts for repairs and pretended
improvements to the canals, a ring which had
founded wealthy and influential families, and had its
stipendiaries among the able lawyers of the State, he perceived
that it was a warfare in which no quarter could be
given, and which could not be carried on by the weapons o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>f
facts and figures alone. He courageously determined to
invade, single-handed, the strongholds of his enemies, and
to arouse against them the moral indignation of the people.
Using a vacation from pressing official duties, he made a
series of speeches in a tour along the line of the canals
from Buffalo to Albany. Flinging aside his customary temperance
and moderation, he denounced his adversaries&mdash;men
of wealth and the highest social standing&mdash;as criminals,
and summoned the people to stand by his side in an
effort to enforce against them the criminal law. Speaking
at Syracuse, in the midst of the men he was condemning,
he said: "Here, under your own eyes and your own observation,
these transactions have been carried on in open
day, by a combination that has sought to rule the State....
I was called upon this morning to speak some words of
encouragement and hope to four hundred little boys in the
Western House of Refuge. During all my journey I have
been frequently followed by persons asking for their friends
and those in whom they were interested a pardon from the
penitentiaries and State-prisons. I have been compelled
to look into such cases to see who are the inmates of these
institutions, and of what they have been accused, and to
ascertain what it is that constitutes the wrong to society
of which they have been convicted. When I compare their
offences, in their nature, temptations, and circumstances,
with the crimes of great public delinquents who claim to
stand among your best society, and are confessedly prominent
among their fellow-citizens&mdash;crimes repeated and continued
year after year&mdash;I am appalled at the inequality
of human justice." He made by this series of addresses a
profound impression upon the public mind.</p>

<p>He was cautious not to be imposed upon by those who
wished his official aid or influence, and commonly subjected
them to a searching cross-examination, but a case of real
distress quickly moved him. I remember an instance which
occurred during my sojourn, already mentioned, at the
Governor's mansion in Albany. We were at work together
rather late one evening, when he was told that a little girl
wished to see him. She was wretchedly clad, and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
to be in great misery. Moments were then quite precious
to him, but he dropped everything and spent half an hour
with her. When he returned to the library where we were
at work he told me her tale. It was that she was the oldest
of several children; that her father was a drunkard and
cruel to her mother, who also sometimes got intoxicated&mdash;though,
as the girl said, only when her father abused her&mdash;and
who had, the day before, although having a nursing
infant only a few weeks old, been sent to prison for ten
days for drunkenness; that the little girl had been vainly
endeavoring to take care of the infant and the rest of the
family, but had given up in despair. The Governor seemed
a good deal moved at this separation of mother and infant,
and spoke with indignation of the manner in which the
criminal law was administered in the lower courts by incompetent
magistrates. He immediately despatched a
secretary to the executive chamber for a sealed pardon in
blank, filled it up and signed it, and sent the same secretary
with the girl to the prison, with instructions to see that
the woman was released and taken to her home that very
night. I asked him whether this was not rather hasty and
inconsiderate action, adding that possibly the magistrate,
if consulted, might give a different statement of the case.
He answered: "No, and I wouldn't believe him if he did.
Don't I know that the little girl told me the truth?"</p>

<p>In assigning to Governor Tilden capacities for public
usefulness superior to those of other men of his generation,
one qualification should perhaps be made. He could not
have led, or rather guided, as Lincoln did, the storm of
patriotic passion which the Southern insurrection aroused.
There are resistless currents in human affairs which disdain
the feeble control of mere reason, and insist upon working
their way by force alone. War is a conflict of the
passions, and, when it becomes necessary or preferable to
peace, those passions should be inflamed rather than
checked.</p>

<p>But the superior <i>wisdom</i> of Governor Tilden was equally
manifest in this great crisis, although, perhaps, incapable
of dealing with it. Naturally anti-slavery, he had encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
the first tendencies towards the assertion of the Free-soil
sentiment of the North by joining in the revolt of the
Northern Democrats against the nominees of the Democratic
convention in 1848, and supporting the candidates
nominated at the Barnburners' convention at Utica. But
when he saw this movement developing into the formation
of a permanent political organization under the name of
the Republican party, with the avowed object of preventing
by <i>national legislation</i> any further extension of slavery, he
paused and receded.</p>

<p>The argument of the supporters of the new movement
was that Congress had the power, not, indeed, to interfere
with slavery in the States, but to prevent its establishment
in the Territories; and that they were but exercising their
constitutional rights in forming a party for the purpose of
securing such legislation. Tilden could not deny the mere
claim of constitutional right; but this, with him, was but
a small part of the question. What would be the consequence
of a successful assertion of that right? Could it
be reasonably supposed that the Southern States would view
it otherwise than as an attack upon what they deemed to be
a vital interest? Would not its necessary effect be to force
unanimity among them in opposition to the policy? Was
the supposition that there was any considerable Free-soil
sentiment in the South which would array itself on the side
of the government anything but a dream? Should we not
have two strictly sectional parties arrayed upon the question
of preserving or destroying an institution which one
of them, not unnaturally, regarded as essential to self-existence?
These, in his view, were questions which must
be first solved before such a movement could be encouraged.
His solution led him to the conclusion that war would be
the necessary result of such action; and this involved the
further inquiry whether the object in view would be gained
by a civil war, or, if gained, would be worth the terrible cost.
Appalled by the uncertainties and terrors of such a conflict,
he took refuge, as Mr. Webster had before him, in
the belief that the natural forces in operation would of
themselves accomplish all that could be gained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> the policy
of restriction. In a letter to William Kent in 1860, before
the election of Lincoln, he stated his conclusions and the
reasoning which led to them with his characteristic moderation,
but with masterly force. His main conclusion was that
if the Republican party should be successful, the national
government in the Southern States would cease to be self-government,
and become a government by one people over
another distinct people&mdash;a thing impossible with our race,
except as a consequence of successful war, and even then
incompatible with our democratic institutions. He said:</p>

<p>"I assert that a controversy between powerful communities,
organized into governments, of a nature like that
which now divides the North and South, can be settled only
by convention or by war. I affirm this upon the universal
principles of human nature, and the collective experience
of all mankind." And again: "A condition of parties in
which the federative government shall be carried on by a
party having no affiliations in the Southern States is impossible
to continue. Such a government would be out of
all relation to those States. It would have neither the
nerves of sensation which convey intelligence to the intellect
of the body politic, nor the ligaments and muscles
which hold its parts together and move them in harmony.
It would be in substance the government of one people by
another people. That system will not do with our race."</p>

<p>This reasoning was founded upon the facts of human
nature, the philosophy of government, and the teachings of
experience. Its truth is more manifest now than when it
was uttered. Who of the great Free-soil leaders would
have had the hardihood to persist in their course if they
could have foreseen the consequences so clearly? Greeley,
terrified by the horrible spectacle of war, was driven to say:
"Let the wayward sisters depart in peace." Seward's short
vision predicted that it would be all over "in sixty days"!
But in great crises the foresight of the wisest is but blindness.
Were it always given men to see what they are to
go through with, the greatest steps in moral advancement
would never be taken. Tilden did not foresee, through the
storms of war, any more than others, the freedom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
slave with the acquiescence of the master, and the consequent
unification of the republic.</p>

<p>But the trials of our popular system of government were
not terminated by the simultaneous overthrow of the Rebellion
and slavery. It may be, rather, that they have just
begun. We were confident before the war that slavery was
the source of the only peril which really threatened us.
That out of the way, we find ourselves confronted with new
dangers, growing out of differences of opinion respecting
the extent to which the black race shall be allowed to participate
in government. That participation is now practically
denied by the Southern States, and the mandate of
the Constitution is unhesitatingly set at naught by the employment
either of force or fraud. The remedy suggested
is an enforcement of that mandate by Federal legislation,
which means simply the enforcement of its will by one
section against that of the other. This is not democratic
government, but the rule of the conquered by the conqueror.
The evil is bad enough; and the remedy will probably be
worse. We begin to see that the real danger which has at
all times menaced us is the presence on our soil of a different
race, unequal, for the present, at least, to the great office
of self-government. Slavery was not itself the evil, but
only one of the methods of dealing with it. Is our substitute,
the bestowal upon the race of universal suffrage, a
successful device? And, if this must be abandoned, what
shall next be tried? These grave problems, already threatening,
will assume a graver aspect if the results of the
census just taken, when studied and compared, shall be
found to show a more rapid rate of increase in the black
population at the South than in the white. To meet such
perils we need nothing so much as a class of statesmen
of which Samuel J. Tilden was the most distinguished
example.</p>

<p>In 1801 President Jefferson appointed Robert R. Livingston,
then Chancellor of the State of New York, as Minister
to France. On his return, in 1804, Livingston brought with
him some sheep from Spain, then the home of the famous
Merino breed, developed from races of sheep originally introduced
into the peninsula by the Romans. In 1809-10 a
flock of 4000 Merino sheep were brought into the United
States to meet the demand created by Mr. Livingston's first
importation. The following letter from the father of
Samuel J. Tilden, written the very season of the larger importation,
justifies the presumption that such importation
had been made by Mr. Livingston himself or at his behest.
The letter of Elam Tilden was sent to his son Samuel by
the late Eliphalet Nott Potter in December, 1882, with a
note in which he said:</p>

<p>"In looking over a package of Livingston letters I find
the enclosed, and thinking that possibly it may be of some
slight interest to you, I beg that you will accept it with best
wishes of the season and for the New Year."</p>

<p>This letter was written four years before the writer's son
Samuel J. was born.</p>

<p>The most disastrous fire with which the city of New York
has ever yet been visited is referred to in the following
letter. It reduced to ashes pretty much every structure
within the area bounded by Wall and Broad streets and the
East River, a tract which then embraced nearly, if not quite
all the important commission houses in the city; crippled
all our insurance companies, and gave to the territory it
covered a blow from which, after a lapse of nearly three-quarters
of a century, it has but partially recovered. Like
the great fire of London in the seventeenth century, it is
still referred to as the <i>Great Fire</i> of 1835.</p>


<h3>S. J. TILDEN TO ELAM TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>December 11, 1833</i>. Friday, <i>2.30 P.M.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Father</span>,&mdash;The last has been the most calamitous
night New York ever saw. The very centre of the
commercial part of the city&mdash;from Wall Street across
William and nearly to Broad, and to Coenties Slip,&mdash;all
is a mass of smouldering ruins. A concurrence of unfortunate
circumstances rendered the fire thus disastrous. The
engines had been much disordered, in consequence of the
extensive fires on the previous night&mdash;the hose, many of
them, frozen and unfit for use. The atmosphere was in a
state peculiarly calculated to support and extend combustion,
the wind blew with great violence, and the weather
was so intensely cold as to clog and almost close up with
ice the hose. The flames raged through the whole night
with uncontrolled violence, impressing every beholder with
the utter impotency of human effort to contend with the
devouring element. The spectacle was grand and awful
beyond conception. I shall not attempt to describe it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>All
the fires that ever occurred here before were perfectly insignificant
in comparison.</p>

<p>"The question is now, not who is injured, but who has
escaped? Almost all I know are involved in the common
catastrophe. At No. 12, Mr. Hichcock burnt out; Mr.
Birch, not even his books and papers saved. Mr. Brown
burnt out, and his goods consumed in the street or in the
stores to which they were removed. Mr. Starkweather not
yet injured, but in imminent danger. Mr. Williams' employees,
everything destroyed; and also Mr. Conckling's,
I believe. At 14, Mr. Stewart's employees. At 20, Mr.
Bronson among the lost; Mr. Soullard, same; Mr. Davis
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escaped. Halsted and Baines, $40,000 lost;
20 to 30,000 saved. Hunt and Andrews, Conckling &amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"So vast is the destruction that insurance affords but a
very insufficient security. The whole insurance capital of
the city will scarce exceed one-half the amount of property
consumed in one night! Estimates are very vague and uncertain&mdash;the
loss, however, can hardly be less than twenty
millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Silas Wright took the oath of office as Senator of the
United States from the State of New York on the 14th of
January, 1833, and in the thirty-seventh year of his age.
He is still regarded in his native State as one of the half-dozen
wisest statesmen that ever occupied a seat in the
Upper House of our national legislature. He was a warm
supporter of the administrations of Jackson and Van
Buren, and the most eminent victim of New York's successful
opposition to the conversion of the Territory of Texas
into five more sovereign slave-holding States of the Union.
He was also a close friend and constant correspondent of
Elam Tilden and of his two elder sons.</p>

<p>The letter which follows reached Mr. S<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>. J. Tilden only
a few weeks before he was deprived of the Presidency by
the 7-to-6 vote of the Electoral Tribunal of 1876. It connotes
Senator Wright's first appearance in the Supreme
Court of the United States. Mr. Waddell, to whom Mr.
Tilden was indebted for Wright's letter, had been United
States marshal during the administration of Mr. Van
Buren.</p>

understand, to see a disease so full of terror fastening itself

<p>President Harrison died just one month after his inauguration,
a casualty from which the Whig party never fully
recovered. To the Congress which convened in extra session
May 31, 1841, President Tyler intimated his desire
that the members of that body should request a plan for a
national bank from Mr. Ewing, then Secretary of the Treasury.
In pursuance of the resolutions for this purpose
adopted by both Houses, Mr. Ewing sent in a bill for the
incorporation of the "Fiscal Bank of the United States,"
the essential features of which were framed in accordance
with the President's suggestions. The bill passed Congress
August 6, with a clause concerning branch banks differing
from Mr. Ewing's, which was vetoed by the President. The
letter from Mr. Tilden which follows was a criticism of this
bill, and probably had something to do with its untimely
fate.</p>

<p>It does not appear from the copy to whom this letter was
addressed by Mr. Tilden, but it was probably to Senator
Wright.</p>

<p>Congress subsequently passed another bill intended to
meet the objections of President Tyler. He concluded he
could not approve it without inconsistency, and therefore
vetoed that bill also, by which act he alienated the United
States Bank wing of the Whig party to such an extent as
to make many friends among the party of the opposition.
It is to that phase of that absorbing bank issue at Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>hington
that Mr. Tilden refers in the succeeding letter to Mr.
Nelson J. Waterbury, then a very earnest, active, and intelligent
Democratic politician, a few years Mr. Tilden's
junior.</p>


<h3>TO MR NELSON J. WATERBURY</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"<span class="smcap">New Lebanon</span>, <i>September 11, 1841</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Waterbury</span>,&mdash;On a flying visit of a few
hours, which I made to the city some two weeks ago, I received
your letter, but I was so busy in running about the
country that I did not get a chance to answer it.</p>

<p>"You judge rightly as to my sympathy with your sentiments
and action in regard to the veto. Our line of duty
is plain. While we render to Tyler liberal credit for every
good act he does, and sustain every right measure which he
proposes, and defend him against the unjust and unconstitutional
attacks of the Whigs, we cannot give his administration
an unqualified support, or commit ourselves in
favor of his re-election. So far, we agree with him only on
the bank question&mdash;and there as to <i>act</i> of the veto, not as
to its reasons, which are qualified and hesitating, and mingled
with crudities and unsoundness; while as to the other
questions&mdash;some of which are of great, if not equal, importance&mdash;we
differ from him. If his course had been less
objectionable we ought still to keep ourselves uncommitted
as to the succession. We cannot enter into a bargain of
office for measures. Whatever he does right, he must do
spontaneously, and we will freely and heartily support,
leaving the future to take care of itself.</p>

<p>"I never regarded Tyler as a man of very high capacity,
and his public documents since he has been President have
not increased my estimate of him. The last veto&mdash;which
I have just read over&mdash;is better in matter and manner than
the former, which was very objectionable in principle, but
neither of them is creditable.</p>

<p>"I will confess that at first I was not without apprehensions
that Tyler's course might be such as to conciliate a
portion of our people, and weaken the efficiency of our
action, while it would not be such as we could fully approve
or safely support; and that he might construct a half-and-half
administration in which real and thorough democratic
principles might suffer more than by open hostility. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
my fears are diminished. Our people seem to be taking the
right ground; and the enthusiasm at first excited will, I
believe, settle at about the right point. A gentleman to
whose opinion I very much defer thinks that Tyler is not
a man to accumulate any political strength around him;
and can in no event be dangerous.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your favor of the 15th ult., directed
to me at my home, came round to me here on this day. I
left home on the day of the date of your letter, and when I
reached New York found you had left there but a day or
two before. I had a very pleasing visit from your son at my
room at the City Hotel, but should have been greatly pleased
if your visit to the city had been prolonged, as my stay was
unusually long and I could have seen more of you than I
have been enabled to see for many years.</p>

<p>"Our victory has been truly great and gratifying, and
yet your strong, practical thinking has, in my judgment,
brought you, as it almost always does, to a correct conclusion
as to consequences. If the Whigs had retained the
Senate for this year it would probably have been easier for
us to have regained the State completely next year. We
must not, however, complain of prosperity, and especially
when it comes, as I think it has come now, by the sole energies
of "the sober second thought" of an honest people.
We must meet the crisis as it meets us. We must show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
people the truth as to our finances, and then act as honest
men would act, determined to pay their debts and avoid
insolvency. Everything hangs upon the action of our Legislature
during the coming session. If our friends in that
body are bold and frank and honest the people will sustain
them, but if they underrate the intelligence and patriotism
of the people and continue the attempts to humbug them
and to purchase their good-will by their own credit sold in
the market at eighty cents for the dollar, we shall as certainly
be beaten next fall as we have beaten the Whigs this.
These seem to me to be truths so plain that no one can
mistake them, and I still tremble with fear lest some of
those elected to the legislature as Republicans may, from
mistaken views, from apprehensions of local expediency,
from selfish interests, or from some other improper or unwise
impulse, urge a continuance of our system of extravagance
and resist the measures indispensably necessary to a
return to health and soundness.</p>

<p>"I have little fear of what may be done here beyond
what was done at the extra session. An effort will doubtless
be made to rouse the tariff feeling again, but our point,
as I think, should be to raise no more revenue in any way,
or for any purpose, until the land-distribution bill is repealed
and the system of giving away the revenue we have
is formally abandoned.</p>

<p>"I have very little hope from President Tyler, except
that he may prevent some mischief which his party would
otherwise do. I do not think there is enough of him to
build upon, or that he has enough of the democratic principles
and sympathies left to govern him.</p>

<p>"I have not a moment of time more. Please let me hear
often, and believe me,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 18th Dec. has remained
a long time without an answer, and I cannot now
answer it, but a single subject collateral to it.</p>

<p>"Within the last two days I have received two let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ters concerning
your Post-Office matters, which have deserved and
received my attention. I cannot do here all my friends ask,
and have a right to ask, and from me especially, deserve,
but I try to do all I can; and yet unselfishness and indolence
may often induce me to think that I do what I can,
when I might do much more. I fear I have exhibited myself
to you in this way in reference to your Post-Office.
But of that I have not time to write, nor do I wish you to
think, as I know you give me more credit for faithfulness
than I merit, and I give you every possible credit for valuable
and faithful friendship. I will, therefore, to the New
Lebanon Post-Office.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Bryant, of the <i>Evening Post</i>,
are the gentlemen to whose letters I refer. As the Senate
did not meet to-day, I have had the day to devote to business
of this character, and I have just returned, at 3 o'clock
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, from a day most pleasantly spent in attention to them.</p>

<p>"Upon a personal call at the Post-Office Department I
learned that, in September last, an application was made to
have the name of the post-office at the Springs changed from
that of 'Columbia Hall' to that of 'New Lebanon Springs,'
and to have Mr. Bull removed as postmaster and Mr.
Nichols appointed. Both these things were done, and Mr.
Fuller, the Assistant Postmaster-General, who has the
charge of the appointments, supposed at the time, and now
supposes, that the effect of that action was to remove the
office from the Springs to Lebanon village, the location of
the New Lebanon post-office, when you kept it. I suppose
he is wholly mistaken, and as you are a matter-of-fact man,
I wish you to send me papers properly signed by such disinterested
men as you may see to be the most proper men,
showing where the office was kept under Mr. Bull and
where it is kept under Mr. Nichols; and in the same papers
you may show, if you please, where your office was kept
and where the office you formerly held is now kept. Let
the papers be directed to the Postmaster-General, and have
no political, but a mere local bearing, and make a map which
will be plain, and if convenient let the men who vouch the
facts be Whigs as well as Democrats.</p>

<p>"You must find my apology for this very hasty and bad-looking
letter in the fact that since I began to write it I
have heard of the death of a member of our body, Mr.
Dixon, of Rhode Island, and have been summoned to attend
his remains and participate in arrangements for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

<p>The nomination, election, and inauguration of Senator
Wright as Governor of New York State, in 1844, gave Mr.
Tilden a greater influence perhaps than was possessed by
any other individual in the dispensation of the patronage
of the Executive at this time. His friend, John W. Edmonds,
in whose office he had studied his profession, a
native of the same county as himself, and a lawyer of considerable
ability, was anxious for the appointment of Surrogate
of New York city. Though he failed in this effort,
he subsequently was appointed one of the Justices of the
Supreme Court, largely, not to say entirely, through Mr.
Tilden's influence.</p>

<p>By the spring elections of 1844 both the old parties were
thrown into confusion and driven from the field by the
"Native American" party, so called, which appeared with
a suddenness and force of a tropical cyclone and swept the
country.</p>

<p>The friends of Mr. Van Buren in New York naturally
looked to Mr. Van Buren as their candidate for a renomination
to the Presidency. He was defeated, however, in the
national convention, and James K. Polk, of Tennessee,
received the nomination. The following letter from Mr.
Tilden to his brother is the only account we have from his
pen of his experiences in that convention to which he was a
delegate. Unhappily, the manuscript is incomplete.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Here we are in a state of extraordinary
excitement and great uncertainty. There is a deep
and almost universal disaffection in the South. Virginia is
against us by a large majority, also North Carolina, Ga.,
Miss., Ark., La., probably Maryland, Indiana; New Jersey,
Michigan, Alabama, Ill., Conn. doubtful; N. Y., Missouri,
Ohio, N. H., Vermont, R. I. reliable; Penn. instructed
and ready to vote with us on the main question, but
liable, some of them, to cheat on collaterals.</p>

<p>"We have a small fixed majority certain on the first
ballotings, but some of the Penn. delegates and probably
some others may be and probably will be inclined very so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>on
to desert. But the plan of the disaffected is to require a
two-third vote to make a nomination. This, they think, and
probably with correctness, that Mr. V. B. cannot get, and
then they may bargain with those who vote with us but are
not hearty in our cause. Some of the Penn. men who are
instructed and are therefore obliged to vote for V. B. would
prefer Buchanan&mdash;have been approached by propositions
from the South to bargain with them, with what effect we
cannot know."</p>

<p>Senator Wright yielded very reluctantly to the irresistible
pressure of both divisions of his party that he should accept
the nomination tendered him for Governor at the fall
election of 1844. It was apparent to the friends of Mr.
Polk that he could not carry the State of New York without
the support of the friends of Mr. Van Buren and
Wright, and no less of a sacrifice than the transfer of Mr.
Wright from the Senate to the Governorship could make
the State reasonably secure for the Presidential ticket.
How reluctantly Mr. Wright yielded to this pressure is not
to be measured solely by his far-sighted doubt of its policy
and of the advantages of a victory for the Slavery-Extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
party at that time. He had other reasons of a domestic
nature presented some three years before in a most pathetic
and touching letter addressed to Mr. Tilden's father.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The logic of the situation presented by Mr. Wright's
nomination for Governor in 1844 required that he should
by his election save the Presidential ticket and then "succeed
President Polk in 1848 or retire from public life," and
Mr. Marcy to defeat Mr. Wright's re-election as Governor,
or himself retire from public life. It was practically to
engage in such a duel that Mr. Wright went to Albany and
took the oath of office on the 1st of January, 1845. He had
in his favor a great parliamentary reputation, and a character
for wisdom, probity, and political sagacity, enjoyed
in a superior degree by no other American statesman of his
generation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had to contend with an administration
in whose eyes all these virtues, when enlisted against
slavery, were regarded only as so many additional reasons
for crushing their possessor. He had also to contend with
a very considerable number who still called themselves Democrats,
but who had deserted the party from mistrust of the
success of its financial policy, and who were impatient to
recover some sort of party standing.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden engaged in this canvass for President Polk
with more zeal than in any other except, perhaps, the last,
in which he was himself a candidate, and in both instances
was betrayed by his party.</p>

<p>Not the least efficient of his services in this campaign was
the establishment of the <i>Daily News</i> in connection with
John L. O'Sullivan.</p>

from regard to health or other cause, either should desire
to withdraw for longer or shorter period from active
participation in editorial charge, the other remaining in

It is, if possible, to get the $5000 absolutely; with
a condition that if we cannot get a subscription of 25,000
or deem it wise to publish a less number, we shall have the
same <i>value</i> in such printed matter as we may choose, and
additional matter at cost; which we can circulate in what
way we may think best. My own opinion is that, as a
general rule, it should be <i>sold</i>, at or below cost, which will
itself be very low if the quantity is large and the work
managed economically. It seems to me that in this mode
we could circulate 2, 3, 4, or 5 times our actual capital;
that we should tempt purchases from every part of the
country, and make the most extensive and efficient use of
our money.</p>

<p>"Of course there are a great many details to be contemplated
in arranging so large a machine: I cannot now state
them sufficiently even to explain my suggestions, but hope
to be able to speak more definitely in a few days.</p>

<p>"Mr. V. B. was perhaps less impressed with the importance
of the paper than yourself, and circumstances of
delicacy prevented my taking that view of the subject.
Nevertheless, he was anxious to have it undertaken, and,
since my return, tho I have in no measure availed myself
of the aid which he was willing to render, our people seem
better inclined than I expected. Still, the experiment can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>not
be regarded as tested."</p>


<h3>SENATOR SILAS WRIGHT TO TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>April 11, 1844</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Having labored in vain during the
whole of yesterday to find time to write to you my promised
letter, and not having approached the probability of such
leisure between 8 o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and 12 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, I now
take my seat for the purpose.</p>

<p>"I have conversed as extensively as I could with our
Western friends upon the subject of the paper of which we
take,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and all I can say, as to the result of my conferences,
is that no dependence can be made upon them, beyond
a reasonable effort to extend the subscription, in case
we shall conclude to take the hazard of making the attempt
to establish the paper. The same feeling of which I spoke
to you has produced the influences I supposed it would,
and it, together with the efforts we are making here to
distribute documents, has cooled the anxiety formerly expressed
for such a paper, and especially so when a suspicion
arises that the man's own pocket may be connected with the
effort to establish the paper.</p>

<p>"Still, I confess, I have not been able to diminish, to my
own mind, the importance of such a paper to our cause. I
think our State press, as a general remark, in a very bad
state for the pending contest. The country press has been,
time immemorial, accustomed to look to the <i>Argus</i> for lead
and tone in these great fights, but the <i>Argus</i>, during the
whole time we have been here, appears to me to have been
insensible of the pendency of the contest, as perfectly unaware
of what appears to me to be its true character. It is
not my object to complain of the <i>Argus</i>, and I doubt not
that the singular and very unfortunate state of things at
Albany has embarrassed its cause, and perhaps presented
reasons for its silence upon national questions, of which I
am ignorant. In any event, the <i>Argus</i> furnishes no lead
to the country press; we have no weekly general paper, and
the Whigs, through the showers of the <i>Tribune</i> which they
are pouring over the State, are doing much t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>o get the start
of us and to turn the current of feeling with the impulsive
and unthinking against us. At least these are my fears,
and it seems to me that these must be the natural consequences
of constant effort and allegation and falsehood on
the one side, and comparative silence upon the other. Of
this, however, our friends at home can judge much better
than I can, and I therefore renew the advice I gave you
before we parted here, to go and make Mr. Van Buren a
leisurely visit, and take his counsel and advice about the
whole matter, and act as he shall think best.</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised when I tell you that the news
from your charter election<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has thrown everything here, for
this morning, into that state of excitement and confusion
which renders it troublesome for one to keep cool and good-natured
both. After some months of constant session, the
atmosphere becomes so thoroughly tainted here, and the
members of Congress themselves become either so far corrupted,
or so lost in their remembrances of home and what
the people really are, that they are really more childish and
more excitable than so many children, and it takes more
patience than I can command to bear up against their whims.
In the result of your charter election I have experienced
little disappointment, and see no great cause of alarm. If
our press would improve the advantages it presents, it appears
to me it could not fail to fix the Irish and other emigrant
vote throughout the country; but in this, as in other
things, I fear we shall feel the want of some paper which is
recognized as having a lead and giving the facts and the
aims of the whole party. The <i>Post</i> is well edited for its
place and circulation, but its exchange-list, I suppose, is
not the broadest, and it never has been looked to for the
party lead. I say this in no disparagement to Mr. Bryant,
for no one holds him in higher estimation than I do, and
it is our own fault and not his that his paper has not held
the leading place.</p>

<p>"But I must return to the subject of my letter, and
writing, as I do, in my seat, and in the hearing of an excited
debate, I can say little more, even upon that. You
can tell Mr. V. B. all our views about the proposed establishment
of a paper as fully as I could repeat them to you
as to him if I had the time, and if he shall think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> we
overestimate our need, or the utility of such a paper, if established,
I shall be perfectly content that any farther movement
be abandoned. If he thinks it best for you to consult
any of our friends at Albany he will tell you who and how.
You will let him know, too, that the reason we did not think
of Albany, rather than New York, was that we supposed
the state of things and state of feeling there to be such, and
the relations to our two papers there, those which would be
likely to defeat any movement made there with this view,
or compel it to be made either against active opposition from
our own friends or under dissatisfied feeling on the part of
those connected with one of those papers.</p>

<p>"It appears to me that if anything is to be done it should
be done quietly, so that the paper may commence with the
nominations. I do not doubt, if subscribers are sent here
to be distributed, that many, very many, subscribers will
be obtained from without the State, and especially from
Indiana and Illinois, and probably from Ohio and Michigan,
but to that end all the time which can be given will be
desirable.</p>

<p>"I must close, for I have been listening to speeches, while
writing, until I do not know what I have said or what I
wanted to say. After your return let me know the result
of your mission as soon as you shall find leisure.</p>

<h2><a name="id1845-1850" id="id1845-1850">1845-1850</a></h2>


<p>The purpose of the advisers of President Polk to prostrate
the political organization of which Mr. Van Buren
and Governor Wright were the most conspicuous representatives
was scarcely disguised in the appointment of Mr. Van
Ness as Collector of the Port of New York. Their part in
preventing the organization of five more slave States, with
their ten pro-slavery Senators, instead of one State with but
two pro-slavery Senators, was such an offence to the Nullifiers
of the South that the President, a citizen of a slave
State, was compelled very reluctantly to yield to it and use
his patronage accordingly.</p>

<p>The effort was made to seduce Tilden from his allegiance
to his friends in New York by the offer of the naval office,
then a lucrative and honorable position. Tilden had but just
completed the thirty-first year of his age; the emoluments
of the office were some twenty thousand dollars a year; the
labor and responsibility inconsiderable. Tilden was poor,
and many years must elapse before he could hope for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
such revenue from his profession. The offer, however
tempting it was, he promptly declined, saying that he did
not labor for the election of President Polk to push his private
interests; that when he was admitted to the bar he resolved
that he would hold no merely lucrative office, and that, if
he took any, it must be in the line of his profession or a
post of honor, but under the then existing circumstances he
could accept of nothing from this administration.</p>

<p>From this time forth there were practically two Democratic
parties, so called, in the State of New York: one
led by William L. Marcy, and vulgarly known by their adversaries
sometimes as "Hardshells," and sometimes as
"Hunkers," who were either in favor of or not opposed to
the extension of slavery into the free Territories from which
it had been excluded by the ordinance of 1789; and the
other led by Silas Wright while he lived, also vulgarly
known sometimes as the "Softshells," and sometimes as
"Barnburners," who were opposed to the extension of slavery
into those Territories.</p>

<p>Though the division lines of these parties, like those of
latitude and longitude, were not visible to the eye, nor the
parties themselves sufficiently organized to occupy hostile
camps, the ends towards which they were severally working
were quite as distinct as if they were.</p>

<p>The following letter was probably addressed to William
L. Marcy, who had allowed himself to be made the instrument
of the pro-slavery contingent in New York, and had
been on that account selected by the President as his Secretary
of War.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>


<h3>S. J. TILDEN TO&mdash;&mdash;</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>1845</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"I cannot give you in full detail the grounds of the almost
universal odium with which Mr. Van Ness is regarded by
the Democracy of this city and State, but will briefly allude
to some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"His appointment was not originally recognized as a
Democratic one or received from a recognized Democratic
President. He was personally and politically a stranger;
did not occupy that proper representative relation to the
party here to make his selection proper or acceptable, or to
give him or entitle him to their confidence. On the contrary,
all that was known of his private character and of
his political tendencies was calculated to repel such confidence.</p>

<p>"His conduct since has confirmed and exacerbated the
sentiments with which his original appointment was regarded.
In his official action and his political influence he
has been the mere representative and instrument of a miserable
little faction, whose fortunes he has solved equally
when it was in a state of partial alienation and open hostility
to the Democratic party and its regular nominations.
For months after Mr. Polk's nomination, for two-thirds
of the whole canvass, he was an open and decided supporter
of Mr. Tyler. All sorts of intrigue were employed by this
little band of officeholders and their dependents to exact
from the mass of the party a partial approval of Mr. Tyler's
administration and an adoption of his appointments as a
condition precedent to his withdrawal. Such had been the
abuses and corruptions of his administration in the use of
its patronage here&mdash;incredible to those who like yourself
have looked upon them from a less central position&mdash;and
shocking to the moral sense of honest men of all parties;
such was the general disgust and hostility pervading the
masses of the Democracy which had been for several years
vexed by the abuses and corruptions of the government
patronage employed for the purpose of distracting the party;
so large was the number who had been the subject of exclusion
and proscription because of their very political
fidelity, and so large also the number who desired a new
distribution of official favors, that such a concession as was
demanded would have revolted public sentiment, in all
probability have lost this city by a very large majority.
Such was the conviction at the time of our soundest and
most judicious men, who kindly and temperately but firmly
resisted and defeated the project.</p>

<p>"The perilous crisis in our local politics you may form
some idea of, if you will remember that there were then,
delicately poised and uncertain to go for Clay or Polk until
within a few weeks of the election, a body of men more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sufficient to have changed the result in this State. Mr.
Polk has now to choose between the 19/20ths of the party
and this faction; between the disinterested and honest who
were true to his and the party's interest, and the venal gathered
from all former parties into the common receptacle of
Tylerism, who would have sacrificed both to their own
mercenary objects. His choice between them will indicate
the <i>morale</i> of his character and administration.
Ever since Mr. Tyler's attempt in 1841 to become the
Presidential candidate of the Democracy, the patronage of
the government in this city has been assiduously employed
to harass or control the party here. It was managed by
Mr. Curtis, who was skilful in if not the originator of
all the corrupt tactics of the Glentworth school; and since
his removal, his machinery has been used by Mr. Van
Ness [with] much more industry and zeal and with no less
profligacy."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>March 4, 1845</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received your letter of yesterday,
which is much more acceptable than your personal
presence. Indeed, I suppose that your intelligence from
Albany would have changed the design, even if you had
entertained it, of coming here. <i>I</i> did not expect you to start
before Mon. morning.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"As far as your personal position is concerned, it is sustained
by your renewed declension&mdash;perhaps uttered, although
that it did not need. For be assured that nothing
has been done to bring in question the sincerity and reality
of your declension, as well as the good faith of your grounds,
but everything to satisfy both. It, however, does lessen our
right, or <i>apparent</i> right, to complain of the precipitancy of
Mr. Polk's action before the receipt of Mr. Van Buren's
letter.</p>

<p>"I judge from your letter that every time the excitement
of the particular motive operating on your mind for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
moment to accept any department, subsides, your aversion
returns and strengthens. This shows that it is the predominant
and settled conviction, which ought not to be, without
imperative necessity, disregarded, and applies even in the
case of a <i>recast</i>. In this connection, I should add to the
hasty view of the affair I yesterday gave you that Bancroft
thinks that if you had accepted the War a recast could have
been had, and intimates the possibility as if from the President.
This may be so&mdash;others have thought so the whole
time&mdash;but I doubt, for reasons I will explain when I see
you.</p>

<p>"Last evening we had an interview with the President.
Representations had been made to him which were repeated
by us and which he said <i>convinced</i> him of his error, but it
was now too late to retract if the Heavens and the Earth
came together. He assured us that he had acted from misinformation,
and with the best intentions&mdash;that he would
do all he could to counteract the consequences of his error&mdash;that
he should be President himself, although not coming
in with the same personal strength as some of his predecessors,
and would protect us from any malign influences&mdash;that
in regard to the important appointments in N. Y. he
would rely on his old friends and act with the concurrence
of V. B. and W. He has repeatedly and to different persons
pledged himself as to the Collector. His asseverations of
attachment, fidelity, and fair dealing towards N. Y. were
earnest and strong, almost passing dignity, yet with an air
of sincerity which made a strong impression as to mere
personal intentions.</p>

<p>"Still I have perhaps more fears than hopes. The administration
is captured by the quasi-Van Buren men who
went with us before Baltimore but deserted us there; who
cannot risk the power of the government in those who understand
and remember them; and confederate now against
Wright. At least that seems to me the influence&mdash;which
in spite of Polk's probable intentions&mdash;has shaped the
Cabinet. Calhoun has no share. There will be no one in
the Cabinet on whom N. Y. can rely. Buchanan you know.
Walker has a strong will enough to predominate over all the
rest. Marcy is taken by the same influence which selected
Walker because while he answers some of the demands of
decency towards N. Y. is least identified with Wright.
Mason, Atty. Gen. (unless&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to James) and R. Johnso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>n.
How can Bancroft stand up against all the others?</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have seen Secor. He says that he only
contemplated speaking to Langley, if you had no objection,
but to go no further. That he did not suppose you understood
or thought or expected him to transfer to anybody
unless for a price. That he would write to you immediately.</p>

<p>"You will see Purdy is going ahead for Collector. He
has been recommended by both of the Genl. Committees,
various ward associations, and a German meeting. Secor
tells me he also has a strong letter from Van Buren, and
he went to Albany last night to get testimonials from there,
I suppose. If he is appointed he will fill the Custom House
with a laughable assortment&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent.
I am inclined to believe that he will be more thorough in
turning out than we expected. Of course you understand
that all his recommendations are bargained for; places are
to be given to the men who get them up. If he succeeds you
may rely that the dissatisfaction which his appointment
will excite will be excessive. There is one way to [head?]
him. That is a merchants' memorial, asking that none but
a commercial man be appointed. This would do, and Havemeyer
could be made Collector and Purdy Postmaster.
But nothing ought to be done unless Polk is entirely
straight.</p>

<p>"Henry, my brother, is just down, has been at Albany.
Our friends are very much dissatisfied. Polk's offers to
Wright and Butler are not regarded as having been made
in good faith. It is supposed that he has his eye on a
second term. I incline to concur in the first partially&mdash;that
is, they were mere compliments&mdash;not in the second. I think
Polk is as weak as dish-water, but honest. If he is really
so, and could or would be wise, he should send in Havemeyer's
name forthwith. I do not believe that our friends
north of this can be induced to urge it. By the way, Purdy's
movements to get this office are, and his appointments would
be, a second edition of Jesse Hoyt's. This is by far the mos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>t
important thing to be seen to now.</p>

with the Renshaw business. There will be nothing to call
you home in some days.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO&mdash;&mdash;</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Hudson</span>, <i>March 17, 1845</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;An hour or so before I left Washington
I learned of an act of my friend O'Sullivan which gave
me some annoyance and which I intended at once to explain
to you. I should have done so before except for a rapid
current of business which hurried me here.</p>

<p>"You might, fairly enough, perhaps, suppose that O'S.'s
act, although not instigated by me, was induced by his
knowledge of my views. But such an inference would be
unjust to me. I suppose the thing was suggested to him
by two circumstances. First, his knowledge that Mr. Croswell
had, in December, proposed it to me with some urgency,
and, as (after casting about to discover his motive for a
proposition which had until then never been presented to
my own mind) I concluded to interest myself in behalf of
Gov. Marcy for a Cabinet appointment, which I had at the
time declined to do. Second, the arrival the night before of
a gentleman from New York who said that my name had
been discussed&mdash;in highly respectable quarters certainly&mdash;in
reference to the Collectorship. In reply to some remarks
of O'S. afterwards, I said that even if that idea had been
seriously entertained I should not desire the place both from
inadequacy to its physical labor and aversion to its hangman's
duty at the present time. In that connection, the
other place was spoken of as free from these objections and
nearly as advantageous to me personally, and in reference
to the political administration, as the Collectorship; but I
said, that while the large value and light labor of it would
be attractive, I should hesitate to take it, even if it were
offered to me, which I certainly did not expect, from reluctance
to hold a mere <i>pecuniary</i>, professional office, and
to surrender or so far postpone my professional pursuits.
I did not, I suppose, decide the question, because spoken of
casually, as it was, I had no thought that it was, or was ev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>er
to become, a case to be decided.</p>

<p>"The moment I learned what O'S. had done, I told him
that it was wrong&mdash;that you and Mr. V. B. ought, in no
case, to make any recommendations until the Collectorship
was settled and settled properly, because it might, on some
pretence or claim of apportionment between the different
sections of the party, embarrass that case. I should have
written on my way back to that effect had not Gen. Dix,
whom I saw just as I was starting, told me he had done so.</p>

<p>Aside from this, I considered the question a balanced one,
which I could not decide in favor of acceptance without
some consideration and advice. Under no circumstances
which I now contemplate could I present myself as an <i>applicant</i>
for a place of this description. I did not know that
after what has occurred you and Mr. V. B. would intermeddle
at all in such matters."</p>


<h3>GOVERNOR WRIGHT TO TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"<span class="smcap">Albany</span>, <i>May 1, 1845</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your note of the 26. ult. was duly recd.
and I will attempt to give you a brief reply to it.</p>

<p>"The pardon of Honoria Shepherd was granted upon the
exclusive application of the Inspectors and Keepers of the
Prison, upon the ground that she was effectually reformed,
and that longer confinement would be injurious, and not
beneficial. Miss Bruce, one of the Assistant Matrons of
the prison, came up in person to get the pardon, and said
her health compelled her to leave the prison, that she was
about to go to Illinois to reside, and that she proposed to
take Honoria with her, and keep her with her in Illinois.</p>

<p>"I have sent copies of all the papers in this case to Judge
Edmonds, who was a leading person in the application,
upon whom I principally relied, and he will show them to
you, if you wish to look at them. He, too, will advise about
any defence of men in this case.</p>

<p>"Thomas Henry was pardoned upon the recommendation
of the Board of Inspectors of the prison, upon the
ground that he was in a confirmed consumption, was a
patient in the Hospital, a constant expense, and must remain
so while he lived, and that he had friends who were
willing to receive, nurse, and take care of him, if pardoned.
This was a voluntary report of the Board of Inspectors, embra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>cing
the report of the Surgeon upon 13 permanent invalid
Convicts, only two of whom were known to have
friends able or willing to take and take care of them, and
those the inspectors recommended for pardons, considering
it inhumane to ask pardons for the others to turn them out
sick and without home, or friends. I. Parsons of your city
is the father-in-law of Henry, and takes him to take care
of him. Parsons is a Ship joiner and Spar maker, and his
daughter, the wife of Henry, who came for the pardon, has
a highly respectable appearance.</p>

<p>"The pardon of George Potter was granted upon the
application of William F. Godfrey of your City, who gave
his address to me as No. 94 Grove Street. He brought a
letter of introduction to Judge Edmonds, speaking of him
as his neighbor, referring to his business and saying 'I beg
to say that you can fully rely upon his representations in
the matter.'</p>

<p>"Godfrey presented a petition numerous and respectably
signed, representing Potter, though guilty, as the dupe of
old offenders, the offence for which he was convicted as his
first offence, and him as very penitent and subdued, and
earnestly praying his pardon.</p>

<p>"Potter was arrested on fresh pursuit, on the charge of
picking a pocket in Broadway, and the report of the testimony
showed that he was one of 4 or 5 who must have committed
the felony. One witness was very positive that Potter
took the pocket book, but another witness testified that
he arrested Potter, that he kept his eye upon him from the
time he started to run, and that, upon search, no pocket book,
or money, was found upon him. Yet that he was principal
or accessory, there is no doubt.</p>

<p>"A letter from James M. Smith Jr., Attorney for Potter
on his trial, says Potter always avowed that he did not pick
the pocket, and expresses the belief that, though guilty, he
was the dupe of others.</p>

<p>"A letter from the Keeper of the Prison says 'Potter
has conducted <i>very</i> well, since he has been an inmate of this
prison, and he appears to show deep contrition for his
"<i>crime</i>" and degradation; but he is a man of peculiar
temperament, which renders it extremely difficult to judge,
with any degree of certainty, the true state of his feelings.'</p>

<p>"This is a brief sketch of the paper case presented. Mr.
Godfrey assumed to speak of Potter from personal knowled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ge,
and said he came to this country from England, some
year and a half ago, a young man, with a wife and two or
three children, and with $15,000 in cash; that he fell into
the company of some English blacklegs in New York, who
induced him to gamble, drink, and carouse with them, until
they stripped him of his money, and vitiated his habits,
and rendered him desperate from want, when they commenced
to initiate him into the art and mysteries of picking
pockets; that in his first attempt he was caught and convicted,
while the real rogues and the booty escaped; that
his friends in England had been kept in ignorance of his
course and his fate; that they were wealthy and respectable;
that friends in New York had sent his wife and children
to them, instructing her not to tell of his condition; and
that they were satisfied his disgrace and punishment had
prepared him, if pardoned and sent to them, to pursue a
different and an honest and respectable course, and they
only asked a pardon conditioned that he should leave the
country, never to return to it.</p>

<p>"Confiding in these representations of Mr. Godfrey, I
granted the pardon with such a condition, and I now suppose
Potter sailed for England either on the 15th or 20th
of April.</p>

<p>"Since I have seen the strictures in the newspapers upon
this case, I have been very fearful that I was imposed upon
by Mr. Godfrey, and especially as he has not come forward
either to justify, or excuse, my act. I did act principally
upon his representations, under Mr. Edmond's endorsement
of him, and I should, at the least, have required
him to put those statements upon paper, and made them
upon his oath. I did neither.</p>

<p>"Now as to the matter of explanation and defense, I
have felt in no haste, because I am sensible that I may deserve
some castigation for having been too yielding in the
first and last of these cases, and I have endeavored to school
myself neither to wince, nor to be made sour by fault finding,
which I am conscious I deserve, but to try to be improved
and made better by it. If I were to make a defence
for myself I should make about the substance of these remarks
and this Confession a preface to it, and yet it might
not be either very graceful, or very wise.</p>

<p>"This matter of pardons is the most troublesome to me
of anything I yet find connected with my troublesome <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>office.
The applications will, I think, average from 3 to 5 per day,
from the day I took the oath of office. My predecessor left
an enormous legacy of undecided cases, and several with
promises of pardons after specific periods, which are occasionally
falling in, and this has greatly increased my labor.</p>

<p>"I do not intend to exercise this fearful power carelessly,
or loosely, and yet I feel daily that I am in danger of doing
it. I find that Courts, and Judges, and Jurors, and District
Attorneys, sign with some of the facility which attends applications
for office, and that the officers of the prison are
also sometimes under the influence of the amiable weakness,
so that there is no standard by which I can govern my
action, and it is probably impossible to avoid occasional
impositions.</p>

<p>"I thank you most sincerely for your friendly care, manifested
by your note, and will now leave these cases with
you, and Mr. O'Sullivan, with whom I had a hasty verbal
conversation about them yesterday.</p>

<p>"Will you do me the favor to read this hasty letter to my
friend Judge Vanderpoel, and say to him that I should have
written it to him, if I had not preferred to trouble you with
it, that I thank him most earnestly for his letter to Mr. Van
Buren, and have intended to write him daily, since I saw
that letter, but have not been able to find the time; and
that, while I will hold this as the necessary answer from me
to the part of it touching pardons, I will soon write him a
satisfactory reply to the personal portions of it, for which
I also thank him, as he is one of the last men I would have
intentionally wounded by a careless, and what was intended
to be a jocose remark.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO J. L. O'SULLIVAN</h3>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear O'S.</span>,&mdash;At the levee last evening which I attended
for the purpose, I made an appointment with the
Pres., and am now waiting in the War for the Cabinet to
disperse.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon I had seen Ritchie for a few moments,
and made an engagement with him. I had a considerable
talk with Seth Barton at the levee and with Tom Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
at breakfast. All of them introduced the subject of the
Collectorship, and all of them especially warned me against
imprudence or menace in the interview which they seem
to assume I am to have with the Pres.&mdash;all tell me he is
very sensitive to the idea of compulsion&mdash;and that the
greatest obstacle we have is the indiscretion of some of us
or of those who favor us. They all are exceedingly afraid
that they may be thought to be afraid, which shows, I suppose,
that they are only calmly conscious of their own courage.
But only think of it&mdash;such admonitions to <i>me</i>! the
very incarnation of Falstaffian valor!</p>

<p>"I replied to Ritchie's caution&mdash;which was the first I
received; and which was given when I was talking with
some decision, with great dignity. I <i>ought</i> to have thanked
him for its good intention while I intimated that it was
superfluous&mdash;I told him that I did not come here to forget
what was due to Mr. Polk or what was due to myself; I had
no design to obtrude upon the President; I had no personal
interest in the question about Van Ness or any solicitude
except as it should affect the party and the administration;
my only doubt was whether I should seek an interview on
the subject; I was willing to state facts, make explanations,
expose the whole truth, if the President desired to hear it,
respectfully but frankly; the administration was mainly
interested in coming to a right decision. We had no idea
of hostility to it if it was faithful to our principles&mdash;the
only question was whether it was to assail us. All we asked
of it was to let us alone. Our politics were now in excellent
condition. We could take care of the Whigs and Conservatives
together if the administration would not systematically
embarrass us, and I rather thought we could if it did.
But we thought we were entitled to an amnesty from our
friends at least while we were so busy with our enemies.
The old gentleman seemed greatly mystified, but I promised
to explain hereafter.</p>

<p>
"(<i>Confidential.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Sund. Morn.</i>
</p>

<p>"I was not able to send my letter yesterday, and now
add a word. I had an interview with the President yesterday.
I ran over the case of Van Ness pretty freely. He
replied at considerable length, <i>ascribing the delay in his
removal to the improper manner in which it had been demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></i>.
He did not <i>say</i>, but implied that he had never
intended not to remove him; made no defence or argument
on the question of its propriety; merely excused the delay.
Mr. Butler, he said, had written to him that it would do no
harm to retain him until the year expired, if it were immediately
announced that a particular man would then be appointed.
He complained bitterly of the attempts to intimidate
and coerce him&mdash;talking magnificently about being
himself President and the <i>locum tenen</i> for nobody; said
that in his own time, perhaps Monday, perhaps afterwards,
Van Ness should be removed, but swore with that terrible
oath, "if the heavens and the earth come together," by
which Ritchie and Green and Barton had successively
warned me he might refuse if a mischance word of mine
should chafe his angry mood, that he would not appoint
Coddington. He should select a man, he said, who would
be received with applause throughout the State; on his own
judgment, whom he knew and had served with. Who that
man was he did not say and I did not inquire, though I did
express myself with some freedom as to what the man should
do. Probably the question may now be deemed settled;
for you remember he employed the same planetary concussion
to illustrate the fixed irrevocable fate by which Marcy
was to represent New York in the Cabinet. His solemn
form of fiat, I suppose, answers as the "By the Eternal"
of the younger Hickory, and, being partly of earth and partly
of heaven, is undoubtedly of an improved quality of imaginary
thunder. Still it did not shake my nerves, as a lady's
displeasure might. I took it quietly, and talked occasionally
as I had a chance, not so fully on all points as I wished,
or mean, if an opportunity comes unsought; but, although
I was conscious of having exposed myself to a part of a
very respectable performance for the benefit of the rebellious
Butler, Dix, and O'Sullivan, in which, perhaps, I might
lose a little when it came to be privately repeated to the
Cabinet and confidants, I thought that, nevertheless, I
should not be justified in converting farce into tragedy. So
I behaved well and was myself well treated. I inquired
what was the 'intimidation' and 'coercion' referred to,
and I believe was not very definitely answered. The only
specification I got was letters from three&mdash;not more, he
said, than three persons, whose names, he said, he would
not tell me&mdash;who might never know about it themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
whom he could not answer without getting into a correspondence
inconsistent with his dignity, who might not be
aware of the expressions they had incautiously and rashly
used. Your letter to Bancroft was distinctly alluded to as,
among other offences, alleging 'violated pledges.' I expressed
great doubts whether its contents had not been exaggerated,
and when he said he had not seen it, and it
was not intended for him, advised him to get it and read it.
The warmth of these communications I vindicated as true
representations of public feeling, expressed in honest freedom;
though this part of the subject came up when the
interview was forced to a close, and I could not do full justice.
Some explanations, which it was not prudent to make
in the danger of exoneration, I have since made to his intimates
with kindness but clearness and coldness, and shall
to him if circumstances solicit. Am not I a lucky fellow?
Soothed all day by the fiery Southerns, and then sitting
quietly, as in a summer shower, when the storm is beating
fiercely on those imprudent young men, Butler, Dix, O'Sullivan&mdash;even,
while refreshing myself, putting up my umbrella
to protect them! I only <i>talked</i> treason.</p>

<p>"He felt deeply the warm letter of his old friend Hoffman&mdash;an
honest man. He would swear by him, live by him,
die by him. I added Mr. H. was a true-hearted man&mdash;he
was the last man almost from whom I parted; I had a long
conversation with him. He fully concurred in the indispensable
necessity of removing Van Ness&mdash;in the earnest
and strong convictions expressed by the others on that subject.
The Pr. replied not. I think it was he that told me,
and then that there had been letters saying that Hoffman
would make his own acceptance conditional on V. N.'s removal.
No, it was Cave Johnson afterwards.</p>

<p>"The President expressed great sorrow that he could not
see Silas Wright for an hour and have his advice. As to
what, I did not certainly understand."</p>

not able to take any view of the time or of myself which does
not allow me, in this political calm, to devote myself to
professional and private business on which alone I rely for

My intercourse with the President is official; and the Secretary

be desired in respect to organization. I have acted on this
determination. In respect to measures, I consider myself

land is doubtful. We have an able and adroit opposition;

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A few days since I received a note from
your brother requesting me to call and see him, and I was
distressed to find that in the short interval since I had last
met him his health had become so dangerously worse. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
is anxious to obtain a consulship or some other place which
will give him the benefit of a climate better adapted to a
chronic pulmonary disease, and a reasonable support while
subjecting himself to its remedial influence. I need not say
I felt a strong sympathy for him; but I feel some disability
for rendering him useful aid, which I will in part explain
and which he and you will appreciate. Although he sustained
the Democratic ticket at the late general election,
and did service which I understand has been handsomely
recognized by the President, his course was so little conspicuous
that the impression left by his association with
former events will naturally predominate in the minds of
the party generals. If, therefore, the administration should
regard the case in the light of mere party expediency, I do
not think I could in candor towards them say what would
be of much avail to him; especially as caution in my expressions
being the more necessary lest I should expose myself
to be quoted not merely as offering a particular instance
in regard to which I should have no hesitation if it stood
alone, but as contributing to and thus sanctioning a general
distinction of local patronage which is objected to, in part
on the same ground on which this might be exposed to unfriendly
criticism, and which has prevailed here in the lesser
appointments which most interest the mass of the party to
an extent that excites very great dissatisfaction. Nor does
it seem to me that formal recommendations can at all benefit
your brother, nor anything which I might say in his behalf,
unless the administration desired affirmatively to do something
for him. If such be their real feeling&mdash;if they regard
his case as one to be controlled by liberal considerations, if
they recognize the strong appeal it makes to their humanity,
and if they are nevertheless restrained by solicitude as to
how the appointment would be received by their political
friends here&mdash;it is possible that I may be of some little
service to him, in the only contingency in which it seems
to me any service can be efficient. The object of my letter
is to assure you that if the administration take favorable
views of the matter, as I hope and trust they may, I shall
be ready to do what I can to cause the appointment to be
well received by the party here; and that such, I believe,
will be the general disposition of those of our friends to

<p>The Albany <i>Argus</i>, since the election of President Polk,
had become the organ and an extreme partisan of the so-called
Hunker party and champion of the policy of the
Slavery Extensionists. One of the consequences was the
establishment of the <i>Atlas</i> at Albany by the friends of Van
Buren and Wright. The <i>Argus</i> was conducted by Edwin
Croswell, a then veteran journalist, and the <i>Atlas</i> by a Mr.
Van Dyke, assisted by a very clever young man of Irish
extraction named Cassidy. These two prints registered the
stages of the ineffectual struggle of the Van Buren and
Wright party with the administration at Washington, a specimen
of which is disclosed in the following correspondence
between Mr. Croswell, Mr. Tilden, and John Van Buren,
a gifted son of the ex-President Van Buren, and then rapidly
becoming a conspicuous figure in national politics.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO E. CROSWELL</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Albany</span>, <i>January 27, 1846</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The inquiry which your favor of yesterday
contains is so made up of statements and inferences&mdash;so
very general in some respects, and so imperfect in
others&mdash;that an answer to it which expresses neither more
nor less than the truth must be more specific than you seem
to ask.</p>

<p>"I understood from gentlemen whose veracity I could
not question that on the Wednesday before the recent caucus
you made to them a communication to this effect:</p>

<p>"You said that it would not do for you to make any
further proposition relative to the union of the <i>Argus</i> and
<i>Atlas</i>, but you invited a proposition to be made to you, the
terms of which you specified as follows: That the <i>Argus</i>
and <i>Atlas</i> should be united, at an appraised valuation; that
the joint establishment should be owned by Messrs. French,
Cassidy, and Sherman Croswell in three equal parts; that
you should withdraw from the concern; that Messrs. Cassidy
and Sherman Croswell should be candidates for State
printers; and that the emoluments of that office, if it were
conferred upon them, should belong to the joint establishment.</p>

<p>"This proposition, you said, would be entirely acceptable
to yourself, and you expressed great confidence that you
could induce your friends in the Senate to confirm it. In
that event, the bill purporting to abolish the office of State
Printer, of which you expressed decided disapprobation,
would, you hoped, be postponed or greatly modified or defeated,
and harmony, as you thought, restored to the Republican
party. The result of your efforts was to be communicated
to those from whom the proposition was in form
to emanate before the assembling of the caucus. Your suggestion
was in all respects adopted and followed by them.</p>

<p>"Deriving from these facts, as well as from the interviews
which you had sought with me on the subject, strong
hopes that an arrangement satisfactory to all parties, consistent
with public duty, and conducive to the interests and
the honor of the Democratic cause, would be effected; and
having reason to believe that more of the radical Democrats
of the Assembly and all those of the Senate would assent
to the union of the two papers (being first convinced that
the advocacy of sound Democratic doctrines would be essent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ially
secured)&mdash;of which fact you were, after consultation
with them, advised&mdash;you may imagine my surprise when,
half an hour before the caucus met, I learned that, although
twenty-four hours had elapsed, you had not even communicated
with several of your prominent friends in the Senate;
had not seen your partner and relative, who is a member of
your own family; had failed to keep your appointments;
and, when sent for, at my instance, who was still unwilling
to impute a design to evade, were unprepared to close the
negotiation, to make any definite arrangement, or even a
proposition. Attended as this failure was by the forcing
through the Senate, at an extra session, held in the mean
time, by your friends, of the bill you disapproved, and followed,
as it has since been by your advocacy in the <i>Argus</i>
of that bill, I am forced, in the absence of all explanation,
to entertain more distrust than I remember having expressed,
or wish to express, of a negotiation in which I
engaged at your solicitation.</p>

<p>"In regard to the particular language which your letter
ascribes to me, I have no recollection of having used it, nor
does it, in the way you have stated it, remind me of any
conversation out of which the information you repeat to me
may have originated. Nor does it seem to me in substance
correct, so far as it may be construed to imply much of a
direct personal communication between you and me after
the first stage of the negotiation; or any effort to 'compromise
the questions of difference between the <i>Argus</i> and
<i>Atlas</i>,' further than to unite these two papers, which I was
sincerely anxious to bring about, and after the intimations
from you did actively recommend to my associate Democrats
of the Assembly, while I left them and myself at perfect
liberty to act according to our individual judgments
and consciences on any questions of reform in regard to the
office or the functions of the State Printer. But that I may
not have adverted to the distinction, if there be any in substance,
between your making a proposition and suggesting
one to be made to you which you declared beforehand would
be entirely acceptable to you, and may have spoken in general
terms of the proposition as yours as well as that of those
you represent, is very possible; and that I may have casually
expressed the sentiments which the facts above stated necessarily
excited, in regard to the part you bore in the transaction
is possible, though I do not remember having done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
so, and I am sure if I have not the forbearance is to be
imputed solely to reluctance with which I have put an unfavorable
construction upon your conduct.</p>

<p>"If there is any explanation to be offered I should be
glad to hear it, and to learn if I have even in thought done
you the least injustice.</p>

<h3>JOHN VAN BUREN TO EDWIN CROSWELL</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"(<i>Circa January 21, 1846.</i>)</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have recd. your favor of the 26th inst.
making certain inquiries of me, and I very cheerfully state
my recollections in regard to them.</p>

<p>"On Wednesday, before the late caucus, I learned from
gentlemen of undoubted veracity that you had made to them
the following communication: You said that you would
make no further propositions in reference to the union of
the <i>Argus</i> and <i>Atlas</i>, but you invited a proposition to be
made to you, which you said would be entirely acceptable to
yourself, and expressed great confidence that your friends
in the Senate would be induced by you to confirm it. In
that event the bill to abolish the office of State Printer,
pending in the Senate, of which you expressed your decided
disapprobation, you hoped would be postponed and greatly
modified or defeated, and harmony restored to the Republican
party. The result of your efforts was to be communicated
to those who were to make the proposition prior to
the assembling of the caucus. The precise offer that you invited
was made to you on Wedy. aftn.</p>

<p>"Hearing these facts, and having strong hopes that an
amicable arrangement satisfactory to all parties would be
brought about thro' your exertions, and having reason to
believe that the great mass of the radical Democrats of the
Assembly and all those in the Senate approved of the union
of the two papers on the terms now suggested, which they
thought secured the advocacy of sound principles, you may
imagine my surprise on being informed, a half-hour before
the caucus met, that altho' more than 24 hours had intervened,
you had not even communicated with several of your
personal friends in the Senate, had not been able to see your
own partner and cousin, who is a member of your family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
failed to keep yr. appointments, was found with difficulty,
and was not prepared when found to make any definite
arrangement or even proposition. Attended as this failure
on your part was by the forcing thro' the Senate by your
friends of the bill you disapproved, and followed by strong
and indignant denunciations the next morning in the columns
of the <i>Argus</i> of several leading Democrats in the
Senate, and warm advocacy of the same bill, I was forced,
in the absence of all explanation, to conclude that if you
had not acted in bad faith you had certainly trifled in a
most extraordinary manner with a subject I considered of
great importance.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances, I claim credit for myself
in speaking of your conduct with great forbearance, and
have no recollection of using the language you attribute to
me in your note, tho', as I did not advert to the distinction
(if there be any in substance) between your making a proposition
and inviting one to be made to you, which you declared
beforehand would be acceptable to you, I have doubtless
spoken freely of the part you bore in the transaction
as inexplicable and censurable.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to hear any explanation you have to
make, and glad to know if I have unintentionally, even in
thought, done you injustice."</p>

<p>The public interest in the history of the <i>Morning News</i>,
of which Mr. Tilden and John L. O'Sullivan were joint
proprietors, may be said to have terminated with the execution
of the document of which the following is a draft, found
among Mr. Tilden's papers.</p>


<h3>CONDITIONS ON WHICH TILDEN RETIRED FROM THE
"MORNING NEWS"</h3>

<p>"S. J. T. retires&mdash;surrenders all his interest&mdash;is indemnified
against its outstanding liabilities.</p>

<p>"J. L. O'S. and H. G. L. (H. G. Langley) rearrange
their proportion of ownership. Hereafter to own equally.
The difference of capital to be equalled by credits to H. G.
L., the necessary amount on his advances, existing or prospective.</p>

<p>"H. G. L. contracts to devote himself faithfully to the
business and interests of the paper&mdash;to conduct with the
utmost energy and fidelity the procuring of advertisers.</p>

<p>"Failing to do this, he is to retire, giving O'S. all reasonable
facility to substitute some other persons on reasonable
terms of sale. All disputes and differences of opinion
as to these stipulations to be left to the decision of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The triumph of the pro-slavery party in the election of
Mr. Polk resulted in the revolt of Texas from Mexico, her
annexation to the United States, and a war with Mexico.</p>

<p>At the expiration of his term, Governor Wright was renominated
almost unanimously. If elected, nothing in the
future appeared more certain than that he would have been
Mr. Polk's successor in the Presidency. The reversion of the
Chief Magistracy to such a formidable opponent of slavery
extension as Governor Wright, who could neither be corrupted
nor cajoled, was then regarded at Washington as a
peril, to avoid which no sacrifice was too great. The magnitude
of the sacrifice of Mr. Wright was as correctly appreciated
at Washington, and by the very men who were to
offer it up as a propitiation to the demon of slavery, as at
Albany; but to the short-sighted vision of the statesmen then
in the ascendant at the national capital the political supremacy
of the slave-holding States was to be maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
at any price.</p>

<p>The influence of the Federal government was, therefore,
all turned against Mr. Wright at the Gubernatorial election
in 1847, and it proved to be sufficient to give a majority of
some eleven thousand to John Young, the candidate of the
Whigs.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright, at the expiration of his term, returned to his
home in St. Lawrence County, consoled by the reflection
that the evil consequences of taking him from the Senate
and making him a party to the faction fights in New York
had resulted as he had predicted&mdash;in disaster to the party
and in his own political destruction. He died within nine
months from his retirement.</p>

<p>The annexation of Texas and the war with Mexico which
ensued resulted in the acquisition of vast territories, sooner
or later to be organized into States, to be consecrated to
freedom or to slavery. To open these States to slavery and
reinforce the slave representation in Congress, it had become
necessary to paralyze the Democratic party in New
York.</p>

<p>The first steps towards this end had been taken in the
defeat of Mr. Van Buren's renomination for the Presidency,
and putting a Southern man in his place. The
second had been taken in the defeat of Governor Wright's
re-election in 1847; the third, yet to be taken, was to deprive
the Democracy of New York of its legitimate influence in
Congress and the next Democratic national convention.</p>

<p>In this scheme the administration was entirely successful.
At the commencement of President's Polk's administration
the Democratic party was completely in the ascendant
in New York. It had elected its Governor and
Lieutenant-Governor; it had a majority in both branches
of the Legislature, and a majority of the delegation in Congress.
At the expiration of two years its Chief Magistrate
was a Whig, and its Congressional delegation was reduced
to a meagre minority. The following year the whole legislative
power of the State was transferred to the Whigs by
an overwhelming majority, and the schism in the party,
encouraged by the bestowal of all the patronage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>

friends of those he has treated worst. I am sick of the

<h3>THE FIRST GUN FOR FREE SOIL</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"<i>April, 1848.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>At the threshold of the Free-soil revolt of 1848, ex-President
Van Buren, who was spending the winter in
lodgings at Julian's Hotel in Washington Place, New York,
said one day to Mr. Tilden, as he handed him a roll of
manuscript: "If you wish to be immortal, take this home
with you, complete it, revise it, put it into proper shape,
and give it to the public."</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden replied that he had not the slightest wish to
be immortal by any process that would impose upon him at
that time any more labor; but he consented to take the manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
down to the residence of the ex-President's son, John
Van Buren, who then resided in White Street, and he agreed
that if John would do half of the work he would do the other
half. John did agree, and a few days after the interview
referred to, Tilden and John met at the ex-President's lodgings
to report.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren opened the subject by asking what they
had done with Niagara Falls. This referred to a somewhat
ambiguous metaphor which had found its way into the ex-President's
manuscript. "We have struck that out," was
the reply. He laughed, as if rather relieved at having an
unpleasant duty discharged by other hands, while they went
on to read the result of their joint labors.</p>

<p>After the address had received the combined approval of
each party to its composition, the next question was how to
get it before the public. After discussing various plans,
they finally decided to issue it as an address of the Democratic
members of the Legislature. Accordingly, on the
12th of April, Senator John G. Floyd, from the committee
of Democratic members of the Legislature to prepare and
report an address, read the paper to his colleagues, by whom
it was unanimously adopted. This memorable and epochal
document was given at length in the <i>Public Writings and
Speeches of Tilden</i>, Vol. II., page 537. This address deserves
to be regarded as the corner-stone of the "Free-soil"
party, as distinguished from the party of unconditional abolition.</p>


<h3>S. P. CHASE<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> TO JOHN VAN BUREN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <i>June 19, 1848</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Many of our Free-Territory men in
this quarter are in doubt as to the course which the New
York Democracy intend to pursue in reference to the Buffalo
convention. Will they be represented in it? Will they concur
in the nominations made by it? If Judge McLean can
be induced to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>ccept a nomination for the Vice-Presidency,
in connection with Mr. Van Buren for the Presidency, will
they cordially accept it? If the convention, on mature deliberation,
should think it expedient to nominate Judge
McLean for the Presidency and Col. Samuel Young or
Bradford R. Wood or yourself for the Vice-Presidency,
would the New York Democracy concur in that nomination?
There is a strong disposition, also, in the West to drop the
older politicians altogether and take younger men, who better
represent the spirit of the time. One of the best and
ablest Democrats in the State, I mean Edwin M. Stanton,
said to me to-day that if John Van Buren should be the
nominee of the Buffalo convention he would roll up his
sleeves and go to work till the election for the ticket; and
I am sure that to all the young Democrats and all the young
Whigs in the State your name would be more acceptable than
your father's. Suppose the convention should be animated
by this spirit and nominate men of this generation, would
the New York Democracy concur?</p>

<p>"I put these questions to indicate the various phases
which the movement may assume. My own opinion is that,
under existing circumstances, the best possible nomination
for the Presidency has been made at Utica, provided the
name of John McLean can be associated with it. Whether
it can be is, as yet, in doubt, though I fear the doubt will
be resolved against my wish. If it cannot be, we have no
man in the West whose name on the ticket would be altogether
unexceptionable. If Judge McLean should consent
to allow his name to be used, the ticket would undoubtedly
sweep Ohio, and would gain immense accessions of strength
throughout the West. I firmly believe that the nominees
may, in that event, be elected this year. It would be, to be
sure, sacrificing a good deal on the part of Judge McLean,
so long prominent in the regards of the people as a candidate
for the first office, to accept a nomination for the second;
and the bitterness with which he could be assailed by
the slaveholders and their allies would exceed greatly that
which is now manifested towards your father. Nothing
but a strong sense of personal duty, and a deep interest in
the success of the movement (and he avows that interest
openly), will prevail on him to consent, and, I fear, he will
not feel that duty absolutely requires the step. It is probable
that he would regard an offer of a nomination for the
first office differently. He would then be the recogn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>ized
head or representative of the movement, and would feel
the abuse directed against him, as levelled chiefly at the
cause. And I think he would represent the movement almost
exactly as Silas Wright would have done if living.
I regard him as more nearly resembling Silas Wright in the
general character of his views on public questions than any
living public man. While, therefore, I repeat that if we
can have Judge McLean's name for the Vice-Presidency I
would rather take the ticket as it would then stand&mdash;Martin
Van Buren and John McLean&mdash;than any other, you will
not wonder that I regret that the action of the convention at
Utica has interposed an obstacle to a different arrangement.
Whether the obstacle is insuperable you are a far better
judge than I am. If it be, then, we must take the Utica
nomination, supply the Vice-Presidential vacancy and make
the best fight we can.</p>

<p>"You will have observed the difficulty suggested by the
<i>National Era</i> growing out of the expressions in your father's
letter, in relation to slavery in the District of Columbia;
and you are doubtless aware that all that part of the letter
in reference to the course of his administration on the subject
of slavery is very distasteful to almost all anti-slavery
men, whether Whig, Democratic, or Liberty.</p>

<p>"I wish that part of the letter could have been omitted.
It does no good to revive the past. Our business is with the
present and the future. Your remarks in your speech at
Genesee on the 20th of June are full of truth. The Free-Territories
question, in discussion, must bring up the whole
slavery question inevitably. Our contest is with the slave
power, and it will break us down unless we break it down.
The people will not stop with the exclusion of slavery from
Territories: they will demand its complete denationalization.
Now many understand Mr. Van Buren's letter, so far
as it touches upon slavery in the District, as a reiteration of
his pledge to veto a bill for the abolition of slavery there if
enacted by Congress. I do not myself so understand it. I
cannot believe that at the present day and under present
circumstances, when a strong anti-slavery sentiment exists
in Maryland and Virginia, which would be vastly strengthened
by such a measure&mdash;so strengthened, indeed, that those
States would by it be converted into free Territory States&mdash;that
he would interpose the slightest obstacle to its adoption.
I cannot doubt that, on the contrary, he would give it eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ry
favor consistent with the proper discharge of his function
as President.</p>

<p>"So many, however, take a different view from mine that
it is highly desirable, in the event that M. Van Buren is to
be the nominee of the Buffalo convention, to have all doubt
on this matter removed, so that he may be received and understood
everywhere as a true representative of the movement.</p>

<p>"The uprising in this State exceeds all expectation, and
if we only can present a proper ticket at Buffalo we shall
have the best chance of carrying the State. But the effect
of the movement is different here from its effect in New
York. The question in this State will be between the independent
nominee and Cass. Taylor is, with us, entirely
out of the question. The people reject him, and the politicians
support him, when they do at all, doubtingly and
without enthusiasm. The Cass men are more active and with
better hopes. In conversation with Judge Wood yesterday,
or the day before, I remarked to him that I was a little surprised,
after reading of the interview between himself, Cass,
and the people at Cleveland, to hear of his advocating on the
stump the claims of Cass, as a Wilmot proviso man. 'Oh,'
says the judge, 'He is for the proviso as much as any of us.'
'Do you mean to say, then, that the Nicholson letter was
designed to cheat the South and get the nomination?' I
asked. 'D&mdash;n them,' said he, 'it is their <i>turn</i> to be cheated.'
This is a common argument among the Cass men; and as
there is something like <i>retribution in kind</i> indicated by it,
it don't take very badly among the people.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to hear from you, and to be advised
of the views of yourself and others, to whom you may show
this, as to what is best to be done and the best mode of
doing it.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO S. P. CHASE</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>July, 1848</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter came here in the absence
of Mr. J. Van Buren, which still continues, and it has been
handed to me by Mr. Bryant, with a request that I would
answer it. I desire to do so with perfect candor, and with
as much accuracy as I can in regard to questions which depend
upon the concurring action of numerous individuals
composing a large party.</p>

<p>"As to your inquiry whether the Barnburners of New
York will be represented in the Buffalo convention, I can
only say that so far as representation consists in the presence
of persons who will be asked to consult with the members of
that body and inform them of the views of the Democracy,
there will be no want of it. But representation of the formal
and authoritative character which is usual in the delegated
conventions of organized parties will not be possible, either
from the nature of the convention itself or the circumstances
in which the Democracy of this State are placed. The convention
professes to be merely a mass convention, and does
not aim at the indispensable characteristics of a delegated
body&mdash;among which is a proportionate representation of
ascertained constituents, whose numbers and relations are
already known; but it will be simply a voluntary assemblage
of individuals, whose relations to each other are to be for
the first time established. Nor is there any person to act
authoritatively for the Democracy of this State, as an organized
body, until the meeting of the Utica convention on
the 13th of Sept.</p>

<p>"But all this is not deemed to be a matter of much consequence.
The Buffalo convention must act with spontaneous
harmony or it will fail of its objects, and the spirit of
the people and the circumstances of the occasion will be
likely to make it very independent of forms. If it acts with
wisdom, the Utica convention will doubtless concur in its
nomination for the Vice-Presidency.</p>

<p>"As to the Presidency, it will not, under any circumstances,
be practicable to change the position of the Democracy
of this State. Their convictions on this subject
would be irresistible, whatever might be the desires of leading
men. Nominated, as Mr. Van Buren was, against his
wishes, and because he was believed to be the strongest candidate
with nearly all to whom they had a right to look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
support, and acquiescing, as he did, on the ground that his
old companions and their descendants had a right to his
name to strengthen them in maintaining their characters
and cause amid the perils and difficulties which surrounded
them, it would not be decent towards him, now that more
than they at first hoped is sure to be accomplished, to seek
another representative. A still stronger consideration would
be the bad faith of such a procedure towards large numbers
of men and influential presses which have been drawn into
our support of Mr. V. B.'s name. Another would be the
great impolicy of changing front on the eve of battle, when
the public mind has adapted itself and individuals have
found relations with reference to the candidate. And another
would be the conviction that in this State at least his
name is far the strongest that can be presented with reference
to practicable accessions to the cause. Of course this may
be assumed to be the fact among the Democrats from whom
our strength must mainly come&mdash;and the aid we have derived
from it has been very great&mdash;while those Whigs who
are disposed to go with us prefer him to any other Democrat,
if I may judge from their expressions to me and others before
the convention of the 22d of June.</p>

<p>"The Democracy of this State supports the cause and Mr.
Van Buren, an organized party having more than fifty
presses, many of which are the longest established and most
influential in the State, and are organs on which perhaps
the contest turns."</p>

in the District of Columbia, I have since my return home

I ought to add that it was written in reply to one from me,
informing him of my repugnance to holding slaves, and my
determination to leave Virginia unless I could see some
prospect of abolishing slavery in the State, and urging him
to step forward as the leader in the great work. He showed
our correspondence to many persons, and urged them to associate
with me and form what he called a phalanx for bringing
forward the necessary measures to put an end to slavery.
Seeing no prospect of success, I abandoned the State, restored
to my slaves their liberty, and removed them to Illinois,
where I have had the high gratification of seeing them
free, happy, and prosperous.</p>

<p>"I have been too unwell to see and to deliver to our old

<h3>TILDEN ON MR. GREELEY, THE LEGISLATOR, AND THE SLAVERY
QUESTION<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h3>

<p class="center">[<i>From the "Evening Post," Dec. 23, 1848.</i>]
</p>

<p>"When we wrote our former articles on the bill of Mr.
Douglass we had not seen the letter from Mr. Greeley which
was published in Saturday's <i>Tribune</i> (Dec. 16, 1848). The
intimation contained in that letter of his sentiments and
probable course in regard to that bill if presented in its
original form, would not have been allowed to pass without
the animadversion which its extraordinary nature calls for,
and which we shall now briefly make, not upon the impersonality
which edits the <i>Tribune</i>, but upon Mr. Greeley, the
legislator, who represents in part the people of this city in
the highest councils of the nation.</p>

<p>"When, after having professed to consider the extension
of slavery to free Territories as the question of questions
involved in the late election&mdash;after having for months exhorted
all to treat it as far above the other objects of party
association, and reproached those who did not so treat it as
false to freedom&mdash;after having at first distrusted the noble
band of Democrats who proclaimed their determination to
maintain throughout the canvass and at the polls the sentiments
which they had before professed, taunted them with
the prediction that they would ultimately surrender principles
to a slavish subserviency to party, and at length applauded
their constancy when it could no longer be disputed;
after having stigmatized as recreant to principle and
duty all who should support a candidate for the Presidency
not avowedly in favor of the Wilmot proviso; after having
denounced General Taylor as identified in interest and association
with the slave power, and probably unsound in principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
on the greatest of issues; when, after having done all
this, the editor of the <i>Tribune</i>, on the eve of election, announced
his intention to support General Taylor, to vote
for a man because he was available, whom he had denounced
for that very reason when nominated as an available; to
vote for a man because he would beat Gen. Cass, whom he
had denounced when nominated on that express ground; to
vote for a man whom, after three months of nice balancing,
he found to be a shade less objectionable than another candidate,
because it was necessary to make a choice of evils between
the nominees of the two old party organizations, no
matter how wrong and dangerous the principles of both
might be; thus surrendering the great question of freedom
in the Territories, in the same manner and for the same
reasons, for which most of the supporters of Taylor and
Cass at the North professed to surrender it, and uniting
with them in presenting the miserable spectacle of a number
of electors sufficient to choose the President, all voting
for men not representing their sentiments on a question professedly
regarded by them as the most important, because
there was <i>no chance</i> of electing one who did represent those
sentiments; when, in a word, after all his former professions,
Mr. Greeley ended in doing precisely what the original
Taylor men and the Cass men of the North did, and for
precisely the same reasons, and addressed to others precisely
the same arguments which had been so long addressed to
him in vain, and which he had been so long refuting, he
shook deeply&mdash;very deeply&mdash;the confidence in his sincerity
which his apparent zeal in behalf of freedom had inspired.
For our part, we were inclined to take a charitable view of
his conduct. We thought we saw him struggling in the
meshes of party association, and yielding not until he had
half satisfied his own conscience that he could vote for Taylor
as not so certainly declared as Cass, and therefore not
quite so objectionable on the great issue, and at last reconciled
to himself by the general sense that it was a little better
that Taylor should be elected than Cass. We thought we saw
a painful conflict with his self-respect and his sense of consistency&mdash;a
consciousness that he had not chosen the nobler,
even if the more expedient, part&mdash;that he was doing at best
a doubtful act against which his better nature revolted. We
are disposed always to respect, in silence, such manifestations,
and not to reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what shall we think, what shall we say, of the
spirit exhibited and the sentiments expressed in the following
passage of Mr. Greeley's letter, which we have read with
astonishment and regret:</p>

<p>"'... And now to revert to the main question&mdash;the
organization of the new Territories, and the allowance or
disallowance of slavery therein&mdash;I have been confidently
hoping for an <i>early and peaceful adjustment of the whole
vexation</i>. The bills of which Mr. Douglass, in Senate, gave
notice on reaching this city&mdash;to provide for the organization
of California as a State and New Mexico as a Territory&mdash;were
<i>signs of promise</i>. Upon the basis here suggested, it
<i>seemed to me practicable to settle the whole difficulty without
farther excitement or peril</i>. I thought we should ultimately
agree to permit <i>New Mexico</i>, as well as California,
to take the requisite steps for organizing as a State, and
<i>bring them both into the Union in the course of the next
two years</i>, leaving them <i>free</i> to frame <i>their own institutions</i>.
This done, the North would be morally certain that slavery
would not be tolerated in either State, and the South would
<i>save the point of honor by the almost certain defeat</i> (in
Senate) <i>of the Wilmot proviso</i>, which, to an established and
admitted State, is confessedly inapplicable. And thus
would <i>close the grave of agitation</i> with regard to slave territory.'</p>

<p>"And the letter then proceeds to say that 'the bright sky
has been overcast' by the modification by which it is proposed
to annex the portion of New Mexico east of the Rio
Grande to Texas, which is <i>stated as the only objection to
the bill</i>.</p>

<p>"The first remarkable thing in this letter is the spirit
in which it speaks of the question of extending slavery to
the Territories now free. If the only thing to be done was
to get rid of a troublesome question, Mr. Greeley's mind
would seem to be directed exactly to the object. If the writer
were one of the conservatives of the Syracuse convention of
1847, who laid the Wilmot proviso on the table, or one of
the Whig Dough Faces of the Philadelphia convention, who
'kicked it out' of that body, the terms in which the measure
is spoken of would be very characteristic. To adjust 'the
whole <i>vexation</i>'&mdash;'to settle the whole difficulty <i>without
farther excitement or peril</i>'&mdash;'to <i>close the grave</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<i>agitation</i>,' was precisely what <i>they</i> desired to do. But if
there is something more to be done than to evade this great
question in order to save party arrangements from embarrassment&mdash;if
it is of any importance to make freedom in
the Territories <i>certain</i> instead of leaving it to chance&mdash;if the
opinion, which has been so frequently and earnestly maintained
by Mr. Greeley, as well as all who profess to be
friends of freedom, that for this purpose an express enactment
by Congress ought to be made, be not an utter imposture
and fraud, then we submit that the spirit manifested
in this letter is not that in which this great question should
be treated.</p>

<p>"The second remarkable thing in the letter&mdash;and by far
the most remarkable&mdash;is the <i>mode</i> in which it purposes to
adjust 'the whole vexation.' A Territory extensive enough
to make thirteen States as large as New York has been acquired;
it is wholly unoccupied, except by a small population
in a few localities. The question is, shall slavery be
allowed to be established in it during its territorial condition?
Neither party to the controversy regards as of practical
moment the territorial condition, except as it will
influence and practically control the conditions, in this respect,
of the States which are to be formed out of the Territory.
And it is gravely proposed at once to declare this
Territory, which is in no proper situation to be formed into
States, and which nobody would think of forming into a
State now except for the purpose of getting rid of the necessity
of acting on this subject, to be a State. And this is
called by Mr. Greeley '<i>settling</i>,' instead of <i>dodging</i>, the
question!</p>

<p>"Gen. Cass proposed, in his Nicholson letter, to leave to
the scattered inhabitants who are to be found in some small
portions of this vast region to decide the question by a territorial
legislature. Mr. Greeley, in <i>his</i> letter, proposes to
leave it to precisely the same individuals 'free to frame their
own institutions' by a State legislature.</p>

<p>"What essential difference is there between the two plans,
so far as the extension or restriction of slavery is concerned?</p>

<p>"Suppose that on the 3rd of March next, at the close of
the session, Mr. Greeley's plan should be adopted; that on
the 3rd of July a territorial legislature should be elected;
and that on the 3rd of September it should meet and adjust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the 'whole vexation.' Or suppose that on the 3rd of March
Gen. Cass's plan should be adopted; that on the 3rd of July
a State legislature should be elected; and that on the 3rd of
September it should meet and decide the question.</p>

<p>"Would it be important whether the government were
called 'State' or 'territorial,' so long as it had equal power
to act on this subject, and constituents and representatives
were the same, assumed their functions at the same time,
in the one case as in the other? Would it affect in the
slightest degree the actual extension or restriction of slavery
which should be decreed by them?</p>

<p>"But Mr. Greeley evidently thinks that this little change
of names gets him over the whole difficulty. And he touches
what he obviously regards as the point of the case when he
adds that 'the Wilmot proviso' is 'to an established and admitted
State' confessedly inapplicable.</p>

<p>"Without discussing the authority of Congress to insert
a restriction against slavery in the act of admission, which
was done with most of the Northwestern States, it is true
that <i>after</i> a State has been established and admitted the
Federal legislation has no power to apply to that State the
'Wilmot proviso'; and that by the unconditional conversion
of a territory into a State Congress divests itself of that
power. But it is not easy for anybody&mdash;except Mr. Greeley&mdash;to
see how the reference of the question, even when confessedly
within its jurisdiction to a territorial legislature,
as proposed by Gen. Cass, is more objectionable in a moral
point of view than the voluntary divestment of that jurisdiction
for the very purpose of shirking off the question
upon the same legislature called by a different name. Gen.
Cass's plan has some advantages over that adopted by Mr.
Greeley.</p>

<p>"It is less evasive and more manly, frank, and honest.</p>

<p>"It may afford some chance that the fate of the various
parts of this immense tract of unsettled lands shall be decided
by the people who shall at some future period inhabit them
after they shall be organized into distinct Territories, the
more densely populated portions having been admitted as
States; which might be somewhat better than leaving to a
few thousand persons in Santa F&eacute; and San Francisco to fix
the destinies of hundreds of thousands of square miles in
which not one of these persons ever trod.</p>

<p>"Above all, it would not, in the miserable attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
avoid the question of slavery in the Territories by admitting
a State of boundless dimensions, incur the great and perilous
mischiefs which we have pointed out in our two previous
articles, to the safety and permanency of the confederacy,
and incur these evils without the least necessity or any compensating
benefit.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Greeley says that 'the North would be morally
certain that slavery would not be tolerated' in the States
to be formed. So said Gen. Cass in his Nicholson letter,
when he proposed under a little different name to leave the
question to be settled by exactly the same persons. So said
Mr. Buchanan. So said Mr. Clayton. Yet nobody denounced
their contrivances with more indignation than Mr.
Greeley. Talk of the Cass 'juggle,' the Buchanan 'compromise,'
the Clayton 'trap'&mdash;the Greeley and Douglass juggle
is worse than any of them."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prostration of the Democratic party&mdash;whether by the
defeat of General Cass or by the conditions which procured
his nomination, it is inopportune here to discuss&mdash;though a
great disappointment to Mr. Tilden, was, like most disappointments,
good-fortune in disguise. It gave him the opportunity
and provocation to devote all his energies and talents
for the succeeding quarter of a century to his profession,
during which period of its service it rewarded him as the
wisest of Israel's kings was rewarded for his obedience&mdash;with
fame and fortune. In less time than he had spent in making
himself a leader of his party in New York, he placed himself
in the front rank of the American bar.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1850 that Mr. Tilden leased his
first office for professional purposes after his admission to
the bar. It was on the third floor of what was then known
as Jauncey Court, now replaced by majestic banking-houses,
on the south side of Wall Street, a few doors west of William
street. His landlord was Alexander Hamilton, Jr., one of
the sons of President Washington's first Minister of Finance.
Here is a copy of their agreement, followed by a bill of Tilden's
personal taxes for the previous year:</p>

<p>"This is to certify that I have hired and taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Alexander Hamilton, Jr., the office, consisting of two rooms,
on the 3rd floor of the Jauncey Court Building, and marked
on a plan of said building No. 1 (it being understood and
agreed that if the above premises shall be rendered untenantable
by fire, the rent shall cease during the interval
occurring from the happening of said fire until the premises
shall have been repaired), for the term of three years from
the first day of May, 1850, at the yearly rent of four hundred
and twenty-five dollars, payable on the usual quarter
days.</p>

<p>"And I hereby promise, in consideration thereof, to make
punctual payment of the rent in manner aforesaid, and
quit and surrender the premises at the expiration of the
said term, in as good state and condition as reasonable use
and wear thereof will permit, damages by the elements excepted,
and not to assign, let or underlet the whole or any
part of the said premises, or occupy the same for any business
deemed extra-hazardous on account of fire, without the
written consent of the landlord, under the penalty of forfeiture
and damages. And I do hereby, for the consideration
of aforesaid, waive the benefit of the exemption specified
in the first section of the act entitled 'An act to extend
the exemption of household furniture and working tools
from distress for rent and sale under execution,' passed
April 11, 1842, and agree that the property thereby exempted
shall be liable to distress for said rent; and also,
that all property liable to distress for rent shall be so liable,
whether on or off the said premises, wheresoever and whensoever
the same may be found.</p>

<p>This lease was renewed on the 12th of February, 1853,
for three years, to end May 1, 1856, for $550 a year, an
increase of $125 a year.</p>

<p>The rent paid for these two rooms by Mr. Tilden does
not contrast more violently with the price of equal accommodations
now, than his charges for his professional service
during his first year contrasts with the rewards for similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

by some of his bills, which follow, at that period:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Nov. 29th, 1850</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;Your letter of Oct. 13th, and that
of Mr. Chase accompanying it, came at the commencement
of an illness which disabled me for some time from making
the inquiries which yours requested. Since my recovery
I have been diligently seeking to learn something of the
line of steamers destined to touch periodically at Vera
Cruz and Tampico. Mr. Geo. Law, who is the principal
man in the Chagres line, and Mr. Wetmore, an associate
of his in that enterprise, inform me that nothing of the
kind has been connected with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>their line; and they agree in
thinking that, although such a proposition was before Congress,
it did not pass. Mr. Brooks, who represents this district
in the House of Rep., and who is conversant with such
matters, is of the same opinion. Mr. Croswell, of Albany,
<i>not</i> of this city, who is interested in the Chagres line, and
whom I was fortunate enough to meet a few evenings since,
has the same impression, but referred me to young Mr.
Worth, of this city, as having something to do with a project
for such a line. On inquiry of that gentleman I find that
he is not aware of any action of Congress on the subject;
that the project is purely commercial, and that it is so
very immature that it can scarcely be deemed to have an
existence. This was for a line between this city and Vera
Cruz. The laws of the last session have not as yet been
published, so that I could not examine them. I am thus
particular, because one gentleman of whom I inquired had
an impression that such a bill did pass. While there
seemed to be very little definite knowledge, my conclusion
is that no such line has been authorized, but I shall keep an
eye to the matter, and communicate to you any information
which may seem important.</p>

<p>"I found in a N. O. paper that the steamer <i>Alabama</i>
will make trips at intervals of about 20 days from that
place to Vera Cruz. The news that reached you may have
originated partly in this circumstance and partly in the
pendency of a proposition, such as you mention, in Cong.</p>

<p>"It would give me great pleasure to aid Mr. Chase, in
the way you desire, so far as I may have power, if such a
line should be established; though the thing is as yet so
indefinite&mdash;and I am inclined to think will remain so&mdash;that
I cannot estimate my ability to serve him.</p>

<p>"The friends of whom you inquire&mdash;Mr. Green, Miss
Green, and Miss H.&mdash;are well and pursuing happiness ardently
in their customary modes: each one pursuing his
favorite phantom, the poet hath it, but I will not apply to
them the association that rises in my memory. There are
objects in life which are not phantoms&mdash;tho' little pursued,
and not by many. I am tempted to seek for myself the
gracious welcome that awaits the bearer of good-tidings by
telling you that Miss. H. intends to leave here on a Sou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>thern
tour in the latter part of Dec., and has some thoughts,
even hopes, of persuading her father to prolong the excursion
to Tampico. But do not flatter yourself too much.
Wind and weather are not less uncertain on the Gulf than
elsewhere, and even the steady purpose and persuasive
power that characterize our friend may not prevail against
every mischance.</p>

<p>"The change in the nat. adn. was as sudden and remarkable
as you regard it. The policy of the gov. was a little
modified by it, but on the whole it was most striking as
illustrating how quietly our political machine works, even
while the hands that seem&mdash;and seem only&mdash;to guide it
are shifted. I do not share, to any considerable extent,
the apprehensions entertained or professed by many as to
a dissolution of our federative union. I would not needlessly
put its bonds to the test. But I think they would
prove stronger than is generally supposed; that danger
would bring upon the theatre of public affairs a higher
class of men than the holiday patriots who figure there in
a season of peace&mdash;men who would represent the actual sentiments
of the masses of our citizens, the serious, earnest
purposes, now applied to private objects, that would be
turned to the preservation of the Union as an important,
practical means to great public ends. The idea of American
nationality&mdash;progress and destiny&mdash;is the master-thought
in the minds of our people, and creates a tendency
to unity in the govt. quite strong enough. I have, too, a
feeling&mdash;for it may be that, rather than a conclusion of
reason&mdash;on this subject, which some may call superstitious.
I believe that the gradual amelioration and culture of our
race is in the inevitable order of Providence. I see elements
which have been and are preparing our country to
act a grander part than any has hitherto done in this great
plan. That part is to be wrought out, not by an indolent
repose on what our ancestors have ordained for us, but by
trials and sacrifices and earnest efforts to solve the great
social and civil questions which necessarily arise in the
experiences of a nation. It seems to me&mdash;but here I may
read the sacred oracles not aright&mdash;that the Union is an
essential condition to the destiny we appear appointed to
fulfil; and I believe it firm enough and strong enough to
endure the conflict of social and political forces which is
going on within its bosom. It will survive them all, working
out what it can, and as far as it can, and cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ting off to
a future period what it cannot now entirely work out.</p>

<p>"I resume my letter which has been in my portfolio unfinished
for more than a week. A current of affairs suddenly
struck me, and swept me on so incessantly that I have
not before been able to return to it. You must not infer,
however, that I affect any special industry, or that I am
ordinarily so busy. My life has vibrated between a leisure
in which I amused myself with books, and the greatest activity
in pubic and private affairs; and, if the last few
months have been as engrossingly occupied as any part of
it with professional and personal business, I do not expect
or desire it to be generally so hereafter. What has most
exacted attention was temporary and occasional, and has,
as yet, produced, and may produce nothing to me or to
others, though lest such a confession excite too much pity
for me I will add that in the mean time what has cost me
comparatively little trouble has been sufficiently fruitful.
My disposition is not to permit merely private business to
engross me, nor to be in any of an unprofessional nature
which creates anxiety. I have never been accustomed to
surrender to it my inner life, or to allow its cares to fill
those little interstices between actual occupation which are
instinctively given to, and which characterize our ruling
habits of thought and feeling. There no doubt is danger,
as the relations of business multiply around us and our
enthusiasm for public objects is qualified or weakened and
our sympathies often come back upon us as the chilled blood
returns from the extremities to the heart, that what furnishes
occupation to our activity without the trouble of seeking
it and without making us inquire whether we choose it,
will grow too much upon our attention. But I desire to
reserve something to better purpose&mdash;something to friends
and to myself, and possibly, if hereafter I can recall the
enthusiasm of early years, with a share of its former
strength and steadiness, something to consecrate life by a
sense that it has not been wholly given to objects so selfishly
egotistical as are most of those which we pursue. It
is time for me to stop; for I am moralizing, when I began
merely to exclude a possible inference that I have not leisure
to care for the wishes and interests of my friends, and to
assure you that I am always happier if I can serve them,
and glad to talk with them, as I now do, even if it be at
such a frightful distance as, in this age of ocean st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>eamers,
railways, and telegraphs, to put a quarter of a year between
question and answer.</p>

<p>"I wrote you a very long letter&mdash;I tremble to think I
ever addressed such a missive to a lady&mdash;all full of finances
and figures, on about the first of October. I mention it lest
it may have miscarried. I should regret if you have failed
to get the answer it attempted to your inquiries. I have
hoped, and do hope, to hear from you in respect to it and
its subject, if I can at all aid you. As a whole, it was not
intended to be answered&mdash;as somebody said of his own
speech&mdash;but I do look for a reply; I hope it may be an early
and favorable reply&mdash;to some parts of it&mdash;as, for instance,
that you are rapidly maturing your plan of changing your
residence to this country, and that, at all events, you are
coming over here next spring. If you should say that, you
may take your own time for the statistics of the money-market
and of money-making. Waiting patiently as I can
for such an answer, and begging you to present my best respects
to Mr. Chase, I remain,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">"Very truly, your friend,</span><br />

<h3>COPY OF DRAFT-LETTER, FULL OF "FINANCE AND FIGURES,"
REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING LETTER</h3>

<p>"There are, of course, the U. S. sixes, if you are content
with so low a rate of interest. The New York stocks are
about the same. There are others which are lower. If put
to the choice myself, I should prefer bonds secured by mortgages
on real estate, or, as we familiarly call them, b. and
m. at 7 p. c., which, with care, can be had, even in the
present plethora of money. There are also many varieties
of bonds of private companies paying 6 or 7 p. c.; but, as a
general rule, I should decidedly prefer bonds and mortgages
on real estate.</p>

<p>"There are also stocks of private companies. Many of
the banks are earning 7, 8, 10, or even more per cent. But
these stocks are at considerable premiums, and have risen
much recently. They cannot be always continuing on the
ascending series. When a commercial depression shall occur
these bonds will feel it more promptly and more deeply
than that of most corporations; their dividends will be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>reduced,
the premiums (which are equivalents for future,
unearned, dividends) will fall off; and you may lose more
by this decline than you have realized in the excess of the
dividends over a fair interest. The same remark is applicable
to the few railways which pay very large dividends,
although they are not so sensitive to the fluctuations of commerce
as the banks&mdash;in this as in the other case. The Delaware
&amp; Hudson Canal Company&mdash;whose business is to produce
and bring to market anthracite coal&mdash;has declared
about 16 per cent. for the last four or five years. The
premium on its stock is now 50 p. c. That is lower than
it has been, because of special circumstances, while I think
that the next year's business will be better. The dividend
is over 10 p. c. on premium and all. I would rather risk
the continuance of its high premium than in any other case
of a railroad. I may say, any other similar case. There
is a similar company which has just come into operation&mdash;a
very solid concern&mdash;which we think will be at least as
good; its stock at a premium of 15 p. c. It is not so well
known or so promptly marketable, and its stock is in a
rather complex form, which it is expected to simplify next
winter. It would be idle to say that I have not great confidence
in it, since I have transferred what I had in the
other to it, and have put in it more than the sum you
mention in your letter; but I should not like to have another
person invest in it or any similar thing merely on my judgment;
and, to do so on his own, he ought to have more detailed
knowledge than could be communicated in this hasty
letter. The claim is that its stock will not advance much
for the next 3 months&mdash;perhaps not for the next 6 or 8
months.</p>

<p>"There are also classes of ins., to some of which I have
great objection, but it would be futile now to discuss their
merit.</p>

<p>"With respect to investments in private companies generally,
I have some observations to make. A very large
proportion of one's means should not be concentrated in
one institution, especially without the most thorough familiarity
with its affairs. A wise selection between them
requires at any time special knowledge and individual judgment;
and more so now than usually. The abundance of
capital and low rates of interest causes high premiums to
be given for the most productive stocks as well as the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>st
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that it is scarcely possible to get them at
prices [half a page is here utterly undecipherable] unless
in special cases where the enterprise is comparatively new
and unknown, or its real merits are not fully appreciated
by the public, in which cases you rely upon what you suppose
to be superior information or judgment.</p>

<p>"I ought to add, in qualification of those general views,
that I do not mean that the market has reached its highest
elevation. I think it probably has not; nor can I now see
the particular time when, or the particular event by which
a change is to take place. We are not in a state of high
speculative excitement; we appear to be tending to such a
state, though causes may occur to check the tendency. But
we do know that&mdash;whether the present abundance of capital
and prosperity of business shall, temporarily, increase
or not&mdash;we cannot expect them to continue for a very long
period, <i>even to the present degree</i>. It is desirable to make
your investment at as low prices as possible, in order to
enhance your interest and have greater security against
possible contingencies; but even this consideration may be
so modified by peculiar circumstances that it is difficult to
state an absolute rule applicable to all cases.</p>

<p>"On the whole, your main interest is to find your money
safe and available when you come here, and are able to
make a permanent disposition of it on your own judgment.
I am gratified to be able to believe that you have already
secured an ample provision for the future&mdash;its reasonable
tastes as well as its necessities&mdash;at a rate of productiveness
which will give the greatest safety. Anything that you can
hereafter add to your income or capital would be really of
very slight importance to you, compared with what you now
have. I do not undervalue your fortitude and energy, or
concede to own to the impertinent advances of time, when
I say that your chief care should be to avoid even the possibility
of being compelled to begin anew the work of life&mdash;so
far as the providing for its material wants can be called
such&mdash;when, if the period most fitted for that purpose have
not passed, the years which have been allotted to it cannot
be recalled. The advantages of such skilful disposition of
your means as are consistent with safety&mdash;and such advantages
there are&mdash;will be to be enjoyed by you when you
shall become&mdash;as I hope you soon may&mdash;a resident in our
country. In the mean time, a deposit with the trust c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ompany
seems to be as good a temporary arrangement as you
can make at your distance from the scene or as I can suggest
in my ignorance of your particular affairs, wishes, and
future movements. I need not add that any aid which I
can give you in making this or any other disposition <i>of
your remittances</i> which you may prefer will be very cordially
rendered. I shall be happy also to answer further
inquiries and convey additional information, as far as can
be done by correspondence; and shall hope to do so more
promptly than I have been able this time, and more briefly;
for without purpose to be very&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to have
been visited by unusual concourse of people talking to me
about all sorts of things and by a necessity of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my
talk with you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very rambling and diffuse. I have
had the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to read it over&mdash;with something of dismay
that I should ever have written such a letter to a
lady, and I must beg that it be communicated to Mr.
Chase, to whom, in truth, it seems mainly to be addressed&mdash;and
to all eyes but his remain forever a sealed book. It
might ruin all my prospects with less forbearing fair ones
if it were supposed there could be any risk of a similar
epistle.</p>

<p>"If you should place a deposit, or otherwise temporarily
dispose of such remittances as you may make through the
winter, would not the true policy be for Mr. and Mrs. C.
to come on here for a short time, next spring or summer, to
make more permanent arrangements? The journey is not
much, and might be more than repaid by the business results.
If you could leave your affairs at home the trip
might be useful in all respects. I have left myself little
space for other topics. But I must find room to say, in
reply to the friendly message of Mr. Chase, that I consider
myself already, in some sort, acquainted with him, and to
beg that he will not measure the little attentions I had the
pleasure of rendering to a lady who interested me, as well
by her personal qualities as by the situation in which I
met her, by the disproportionate sense of them which she
entertains.</p>

<p>"I fear the probability of my being able to visit Tampico
at present is not sufficiently substantial to fabricate a dream
of. My consolation must be the hope of meeting you here,
in which I trust you will not disappoint me. The authority
with which you commission me to 'say many kind things'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to certain of your friends&mdash;if intended to be general&mdash;is
too flattering in its conferment and too agreeable in its exercise
to be renounced. And yet I fear I should not be the
'faithful agent' you hope if I did not candidly admit how
little, in this respect, you need, or can be aided, by any
service of mine.</p>

<p>"Hoping to hear from you shortly, and to see you at an
early period, and wishing Mr. C. and you every prosperity
and happiness, I remain,</p>

<p>The measure for the enlargement of the Erie Canal at
an expense of nine millions of dollars, projected by jobbers
in what are still known as the canal counties, and which is
referred to in the following note of Mr. Burwell, was so
effectually resisted by Mr. Tilden, both by speech and pen,
that it was put to sleep for more than forty years, when it
reappeared and was passed. It resulted even more disastrously
than Mr. Tilden had predicted, and to this day no
one knows what became of the $9,000,000 that were spent,
though no one will pretend that a new canal-boat was built
or another ton of freight was ever carried through the canal
in consequence of that expenditure.</p>

<p>By the death of President Taylor, in 1850, the Vice-President,
Millard Fillmore, of New York, became Acting
President.</p>

<p>Whether, and if any, to what extent, the free State and
the slave State partisans in New York, on whose political
course the next Presidential election was largely dependent,
would be able to act together at the ensuing Presidential
election, had become an absorbing question throughout
the nation in 1851. Gideon Welles had for many years
been prominent among political journalists as editor of the
<i>Hartford Times</i>. He had also been a devoted champion of
the principles and policies of Presidents Jackson and Van
Buren, and was at this time a warm partisan of the Free-soil
wing of the Democratic pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>rty. He later had the honor
to be selected by President Lincoln in 1861 for his Secretary
of the Navy, the department of the military service
which during the Civil War of 1861-5 proved most uniformly
victorious and efficient.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am wanting light on matters political,
and write you for guidance and information. It was my
expectation to have gone to New York about this time, but
as I cannot, excuse my writing. My general views and
my peculiar position (peculiar for me) I very frankly gave
you, and also the attitude of things here when I saw you in
June.</p>

<p>"Your convention is to me somewhat of a mystery, for
I have seen no one from your State to enlighten me, and
there is no one in the region hereabout better informed than
myself. Things have not taken, in all respects, the course
I could have wished and, indeed, expected, but it is not
uncommon that we are controlled by circumstances rather
than circumstances by us.</p>

<p>"My object is to learn from you the course that the
Democrats of your State will be likely to take in regard to
the Presidential election. I need not say to you that whatever
you may communicate shall be in strictest confidence,
and shall be submitted to no other eye or ear than mine; but
it may be of material benefit for you and for us in Connecticut
if I can have some indication of the course which
our friends in New York intend to pursue.</p>

<p>"As I remarked to you when I last saw you, I found
things in our State in a very unfortunate condition when I
returned from Washington, and while I would not commit
myself to the schemes on foot, I at the same time did not
think it expedient or useful to place myself in exactly an
antagonal position to old associates and friends. I have
therefore stood somewhat aloof&mdash;commenting on and criticising
measures and men, to the great annoyance and disappointment
of some, who thought it in their power to compel
me to take a position as they had done by Niles.</p>

<p>"At this time the party in this State which supported
Cass do not mention him. He seems to be dropped by universal
consent. His leading friends, the managers of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
you call the Hunker party, are generally inclined to Buchanan,
but the more efficient and active portion of those
who went with him are disinclined to take Buchanan, and,
to a considerable extent, avow themselves for Houston. I
have been in exactly that position when I did not feel inclined
to allay their differences.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, within a few weeks past and since
the death of Woodbury, some of the shrewd and cunning
friends of Buchanan are talking up Douglas. Without going
into speculations on this matter generally, I can well
perceive the local design and bearing which those movements
may have, and hence my desire to know something of the
intentions and ultimate object of the real Democrats of your
State, for it is desirable that we should harmonize.</p>

<p>"If I could make the next President, Col. Benton would
be the man, although the old man takes occasionally strange
freaks. In a late St. Louis <i>Union</i> I read a strong article
in favor of Buchanan, backed by an editorial equally strong
which surprised me. I am no partisan of Buchanan, whose
course on all recent questions appears to me extremely objectionable,
and, in fact, his career is not one that I admire
generally. Cold, selfish, intriguing, and heartless, he panders
to vicious doctrines; he is not a root-and-branch Democrat,
and I always doubt his sincerity. I should very much
prefer Marcy, especially if he could disentangle himself
from a few bad associates. From some of the proceedings
of your State convention, and a few odds and ends in the
papers, I have been half inclined to think that some of
Marcy's warm friends threw their influence with the Barnburners,
and defeated the extreme Hunkers. This is mere
speculation of mine, without a word from any one, and made
perhaps in the absence of any more obvious cause for what
then occurred.</p>

<p>"In former years I was accustomed to get from Mr.
Wright a letter or two annually that made my pathway
clear, and his suggestions enabled me sometimes to do the
cause efficient service. At this time I feel the necessity of
knowing something of the probable direction our friends in
New York will take, and I must rely on you for hints, suggestions,
and views. There is quite a disposition to talk
up the Presidential question, and our active busybodies
seem anxious to connect themselves in season; and without
appearing intrusive or actually doi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>ng a great deal, I am
perhaps in just such a position as enables me perhaps to do
more active and substantial service than a much abler man,
differently situated. I therefore write to you as an old acquaintance,
knowing that you can give me light.</p>

<p>"Where is our friend Genl. Dix, one of your best clearheaded
and pure-minded men? I suppose things are in
such a condition that he could not be brought forward, but
how infinitely superior to most of the men named for Chief
Magistrate. Let me hear from you as early as you conveniently
can, and believe me,</p>

<p>William L. Marcy had been Governor of New York from
1833 to 1839, and in 1852, as will be seen by the following
letter, he was already indulging dreams of succeeding Mr.
Fillmore at the impending Presidential election, which,
however, resulted in the choice of Franklin Pierce. Mr.
Marcy had too many friends like Van Buren and Tilden
and Dix and Flagg to be trusted at the head of the government
by the partisans of slavery, while and because of those
friends he was wanted in the Cabinet for his influence with
those statesmen in New York; but they took care to put him
in the department where he would have least occasion or
opportunity to interfere with the policy of the slave-holding
class. He was made Secretary of State.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Though I have heard of nothing calculated
to excite alarm, yet I do not feel quite easy as to what
may be the result of the delegate meeting on the 7th inst.
As Lt.-Gov. Church does not stand entirely unexposed to
attacks on account of the canal lettings, I think it would
be quite agreeable to him to be selected as one of the State
delegates. Should his selection be pressed it may em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>barrass
the proceedings. I have information from Washington that
Dickinson's <i>man</i>, Birdsall, is here exhibiting much bitterness
towards me, and has distinctly broke ground for Dickinson
as a candidate. As he cannot carry the State it will
be important for his object, as it would be to Gen. C.'s
friends, to create an impression that no one can carry it.
He will therefore endeavor to get up a scene of confusion
here at the delegate meeting. Though I have no intimation
on the subject, yet I do not doubt that he will propose a
wholesale endorsement of the compromise. If so, the blow
must be skilfully parried.</p>

<p>"I also fear the Hunker delegates favorable to me will
stiffly insist on Hunker State delegates, but will go far to
gratify the other section of my friends as to the particular
persons.</p>

<p>"I allude to these things to enforce the request I make
to have you be here a day or two before the delegates meet
if you conveniently can.</p>

arise in this matter, I flatter myself that our future course

get from Washington that things, as they appear there, are

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for the copy of Hawthorne's
<i>Memoirs</i>. It would have reminded me, if I had
forgotten, that I promised to write you my views on the
subject of our conversation when I last had the pleasure to
see you. I should have done so earlier, but engagements,
which it is no exaggeration to call incessant, have left me
no opportunity.</p>

<p>"The preliminary question is, on what general theory is
the new administration to be formed? Is the Cabinet to
be composed of those who are commonly regarded as Presidential
men&mdash;who were candidates for the recent nomination&mdash;and
are surrounded by the affiliations which naturally
grow up around those occupying that position? It seems
to me that this would be attempting to stand steadily and
firmly on a half-dozen different stools. The President might
himself look after the success of his administration, while
his constitutional helpers were thinking how each measure
and each appointment would affect their pretensions to the
succession; or he might content himself with the formal
honor of presiding over the councils of these heads of factions.
But, in my judgment, he ought to be&mdash;not what
Victoria is in the British government, not a grand Elector,
as Siey&egrave;s would have made Napoleon, not a mere chooser
of the actual rulers&mdash;but the real and responsible head of
the administration. That he may be such, he should have,
as far as practicable, a Cabinet able to perform its duty
towards him, faithfully and effectively, and not inviting
by the aspirations of its members internal dissension or
external hostility. In the last term of an administration,
it may be difficult to exclude pretensions to the succession.
But why incur the embarrassments which they never fail
to generate, during a first term, unless it be certain that it
is also the last! And is it to be now assumed that the
Democracy will look from the candidate through whom it
solved the difficulties of a choice at the last convention, and
to candidates through whom it found itself unable to solve
those difficulties? It is not clear that the party can, after
so recent a disorganization&mdash;if it could under other circumstances&mdash;be
sufficiently consolidated in a single term to
be instrumental to any great public service. But it is c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>lear
what will become of the family discipline and how the
farm will be managed if the old gentleman begins by announcing
his own decease and inviting the boys to scramble
for the inheritance. Polk tried that, secretly meaning all
the while to be his own heir; and while he contrived and
they scrambled, the inheritance went to strangers. Let not
Gen. Pierce content himself with being a loose and temporary
bond of union between factions; but rather let him
aim to fuse those factions, and constitute a single, compact
party.</p>

<p>"Now what is to be done with New York? Some will
say avoid all difficulties by taking no member of the Cabinet
from that State. That would be better than to do worse;
and, if on due reflection it should be deemed most expedient,
I should not personally complain. But it is not a
policy after my heart or my judgment; nor does it tend to
constitute a party out of the fused elements of factions.
An evasion policy, in such a case, is a feeble policy.</p>

<p>"Well, who then shall be taken? The public regard
Messrs. O'Conor, Dickinson, Marcy, and Dix as candidates;
and therefore I may be justified in remarking upon them as
such. The first two I shall not say much about, because I
do not suppose their present relations to the prevailing policies
of the State will make them regarded as admissible
selections.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Conor is a man of extensive and accurate legal
learning, of an acuteness of reason somewhat excessive even
for the higher uses of his profession&mdash;of great mental activity,
indefatigable, vehement and sarcastic in controversy;
remarked at the bar as able rather than wise, and remarkable
for a want of tact. What these qualities&mdash;not weakened
by a life almost exclusively forensic&mdash;would naturally
make him in politics, where they are not counteracted by
the large knowledge, long experience, and settled rules and
habits that modify their effects in his profession, and where
the opposite qualities, the power, not of dissenting or contesting,
but of moulding, constructing, and organizing, of
determining one's self and representing others, are mainly
required, may be imagined. Add inexperience in politics,
very limited acquaintance with its subjects, its questions,
its history, its methods or its men&mdash;unsettled convictions,
a tendency to capriciousness, and as little as can easily be
found of that capacity which enables a man instinctively to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
act with others or make them act with him, and you have
the political aspects of his character. Whether in personal
judgment or action in politics, in administrative council,
in a deliberative assembly, or in leading or aiding to lead
a party of a nation or a ward, his destiny is to illustrate
how little fitted to such purposes may be talents conceded
to be eminent in a peculiar sphere. This opinion is the
result of many years' observation. It was confirmed when
I was associated with him in the convention that formed
the present Constitution of this State, and, in an intercourse
constant and never unfriendly, was a daily witness of the
development of his characteristics. The partiality of his
friends would not change the nature, though it might lessen
the degree, of this criticism. No one has suggested him
except as Attorney Genl.; and for that station, I presume,
on the idea that its duties are purely professional. If that
office did not share in the general administrative councils
of the President; if, as a legal adviser, he were not required
to look at the mixed questions that come up before him
somewhat with the eye of a statesman as well as that of a
mere lawyer&mdash;or at least with the largeness and comprehensiveness
of a judicial view; if he had no duty or utility
beyond conducting the cases in the courts in which he occasionally
appears for the United States, certainly there
could be no objection to the personal adaptation of this
gentleman, and, if that member of the Cabinet from New
York need have no relation to the majority of the party
there, which has the entire State government, and whose
ascendency is every day becoming more complete and solid,
and but a very ineffective relation to the minority, if he
need represent nobody and be capable of representing nobody,
such a selection might not be injudicious as respects
the Democracy of the largest State in the Union.</p>

<p>"I ought perhaps to add a matter of information without
going into discussion of political antecedents that in
our great financial controversy from 1836-7 this gentleman
was with the Whigs, and was not again visible in our ranks
until 1844.</p>

<p>"Inferior to either of the other gentlemen mentioned in
general abilities and acquirements, and to either of them,
except Mr. O'Conor, as a politician&mdash;and not strong with his
State in any of his political antecedents&mdash;Mr. Dickinson
has brought himself into his present unfortunate relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
with a great majority of the party here by the extreme positions
he has occupied on questions which have divided the
State, and still more by the fatuity with which he has followed
Judge Beardsley and Mr. Croswell in a policy which
must have been fatal to the party if it had not sooner been
fatal to its advocate. I mean the policy of resisting every
attempt at an honorable or practicable union of the Democracy
of the State&mdash;on the chance that, while the prominent
men of the section, which formed a majority of the
whole and had many sympathizers from the rank and file
of that section, could be made through the influence of
association with the party in other States; and that, while
the Democracy of the Union should take the risks of the
experiment, those who got it up would, at least, own the
wreck. Fairer and wiser men saw that such an experiment
in a party which rarely commands a majority exceeding
two or three per cent. of the aggregate vote, even if more
successful than could be reasonably hoped for, could have
no result but to leave New York as thoroughly federalized
as Massachusetts or Vermont for a generation to come. But
the folly of the scheme was no less in its personal aspects.
It mistook the sentiments as it underrated the sense of the
masses of the party. They, as everybody ought to have
seen, were in favor of a reunion on equal and honorable
terms. And the attempt to resist it&mdash;which, if openly
made, would have been generally rejected&mdash;was sufficiently
perceived to break the hold of its authors upon the masses
of their own section, who, although sometimes in a collateral
question where old associations or prejudices could be
appealed to showing a large minority have been drifting
from these gentlemen ever since, and many of them resuming
relations with the radicals with whom they formerly acted.</p>

<p>"Gov. Marcy and Genl. Dix both possess the important
requisite of being of the union Democracy of the State, and
are both capable of fulfilling the duties of a Cabinet station
with signal ability and distinction. I express my judgment
between these gentlemen, not without regret arising from
kindly personal disposition towards the one against whom
that judgment, under all the circumstances, must be. But
I shall state it frankly, and briefly some of the reasons on
which it is founded.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, in the first place, that the selection of
Genl. Dix is most wise and right in respect to the mutu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>al
relations of those who, acting generally with both these
gentlemen, since the reunion of the party in 1849, would
be divided in preference between them. On the first nomination
of Gov. Seymour, in selecting a State candidate for
the recent Presidential nomination&mdash;in choosing the two
State delegates to the national convention on the renomination
of Gov. Seymour&mdash;indeed, on most of the important
occasions since the reunion, the radicals, while constituting
far the larger and more effective element of that union, have
conceded almost everything. The magnanimity with which
they have done so, and the fidelity with which they have
carried out the measures in which it has been done, have
been strongly recognized by Gov. Marcy and his friends.
These concessions have sometimes been not without dissatisfaction
at the extent and frequent repetition of them; nor
without large demand on the credit and patience of those
who have been the means of inducing acquiescence in arrangements,
in which, while one side contributed most of
the capital of the partnership, the other received nearly its
entire benefits. I feel some right to speak on this point
without suspicion that I am swerved by personal associations
from a fair judgment as respects all parties, as well
from the general position I have held on these occasions as
from the part I took in some of them.</p>

<p>"It may not be improper to mention an instance. When
the two State delegates to the national convention were to
be chosen, Gov. Marcy, as desiring to be presented as the
State candidate for the Presidency, and Gov. Seymour as
a candidate before his own party the first time after his defeat
before the people, felt their fortunes very deeply involved
in the result. Gov. Marcy wrote to me requesting
me to attend the meeting of the district delegates at Albany,
and I did so. I never knew either of those gentlemen manifest
more anxiety or having to confront more serious embarrassments.
It had been the settled understanding that
one Hunker and one radical should be taken for the State
delegates. Most of the votes relied on to make the choice
were radicals; and prominent men of that section, some of
whom the radicals most desired to send, strongly wished to
go. It seemed to Gov. Marcy necessary to take two Hunkers,
but he felt the embarrassment of asking it, especially
on the grounds that could alone be rendered; and others,
who had to make the choice or were in firmer association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with those who had to make it, were not easily convinced
of the necessity or propriety of such a course. The difficulty
was at length solved by our passing our favorite men
and assenting to elect Mr. Seymour and another Hunker.
Those of us who have, on this and other occasions, felt the
strain with our own friends of keeping the elements of the
union Democracy working harmoniously and efficiently under
such circumstances, have a right to be heard when we
express the conviction that the present is a fit time for Gov.
Marcy and his friends to evince some mutuality in their
relations towards the radicals; and that a more safe, proper,
and unobjectionable opportunity to reciprocate the magnanimity
with which they have been treated cannot be
offered than in assenting to the selection of Genl. Dix for
the Cabinet. Such I believe to be the general sense of those
who have formed four-fifths of the majorities in our State
conventions and elsewhere since the reunion of the party
from which Gov. Marcy and Gov. Seymour have received
support.</p>

<p>"Regarding the question simply as it affects the party
in this State, I think it highly desirable and important that
the occasion should be embraced to manifest that mutuality
towards the radicals without which the elements of a party
cannot be kept in cordial or lasting union, and I think that,
on such a question, the general sense of fair men is more
wisely conformed to than disregarded. Certainly I do not
mean to censure Gov. Marcy for allowing his name to be
presented, or that we have any right or disposition to limit
the range of selection by Genl. Pierce; but simply to state
considerations which, in my judgment, are important in
deciding the choice.</p>

<p>"This brings me to the question how the party in New
York, as a whole, stand affected as between these two gentlemen?
The radicals, who are a full majority in numbers
and more in efficiency, are for Gen. Dix, and would, under
the circumstances, feel some sense of exclusion in a choice
of a different nature. Gov. Marcy and his personal friends,
though preferring him, cannot, as the case stands, make any
actual opposition to the appointment of Gen. Dix; and, if
it be made, will acquiesce&mdash;most, if not all of them, with
cordiality. The considerations I have alluded to appeal
strongly to their judgment and sense of justice, if failing
to change their wishes; and with the relations which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
grown up with many who are for Genl. Dix, secure this
result. The opposition of the extreme Hunkers to Marcy
or Dix will be most manifest towards the one appearing
most likely at the moment to be appointed; but I think that
they are generally less repugnant to the selection of Dix,
towards whom there is less of violence and bitterness in
individual leaders. So far as this may be supposed to arise
from the part Gov. Marcy took in promoting the union of
the party, I regard it as a merit; and for that, with a
friendly construction of acts and motives, we have handsomely
acquitted ourselves towards him. This animosity
has other causes, among which is that he has been in the
way of other gentlemen who have grown faster in their own
esteem than in his appreciation (in which difference I think
he is more right than they); and especially that Mr. Dickinson
regards him as having, by being a candidate for the
Presidency, kept that distinction from alighting on fitter
shoulders&mdash;which it is certain that Mr. D. confidentially
calculated the convention would find, after trying Cass'
awhile, to be of exactly his own management.</p>

<p>"Looking to this State, therefore, I think the appointment
of Genl. Dix would be the most wise, expedient, and
prudent, with his moderation and conciliatory conduct always,
and conciliatory disposition, it will prove generally
satisfactory. Not that all can be pleased. Still less that a
few impracticables in this city will be&mdash;who never have
been for twenty years, when the party was strong and prosperous&mdash;I
mean the leading spirits. Their idea of building
up the party has been to exclude from it a majority as Barnburners,
and the most of the Hunkers as having traitorous
sympathies and affiliations with the Barnburners; and, incapable
of more than one idea at a time, they have continued
faithful to this, until they have pretty much exhausted
the credit they acquired in 1848 with the masses of those
who voted for Gen. Cass; and have lost their influence in
the organization of the party even in this city, while their
crotchets are not and have not been shared in by a tenth
of those who were nominally classified with them. They
may be safely disregarded. There will be no local dissatisfaction
in this city arising from appointments, if those
which are of a local nature be judiciously made. The
truth is the divisions and factions which appear on the surface
of our city politics are pretty much confined to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
petty leaders, and excite attention or interest in but a very
small portion of the masses. They are generated by the
very large number of offices, contracts, and other objects of
cupidity, municipal, State, and national, which are concentrated
here, and perhaps in some degree by the stirring and
heterogeneous character of our population. They always
exist, and have little to do with any settled general classification.
Their effect is to render opinion and individual
character less influential than in the more natural and sound
condition of the rural districts, and to make the organization
of the party, always scrambled for to promote personal
ends, a much less true index of the real sentiments of the
party. So far as the relations of the administration with
the party in this city are to be effected at all by its appointments,
assuming them, of course, to be intrinsically proper
and reputable, it would be incomparably more by the multitude
of little ones than by the large. While the appointments
here should be made with primary reference to the
honest and efficient discharge of official duties, a judicious
care should be had for the harmonizing and conciliating
the entire party. The one or two which have extensive
subordinate patronage should not be surrendered to the
bigotry of clique or of individuals on the idea of a partition
between factions, but should be entrusted to persons who
have largeness of views, judgments, and local knowledge
enough to administer the subordinate patronage on the same
principle on which the administration itself acts. With
such a policy the disturbing causes will be reduced to a
minimum and the party will move on in general unity and
strongly ascendant. I will venture what character I have
for political judgment that no perceptible obstacle to this
result would be found in the selection of Gen. Dix for the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>"There is another consideration in respect to that gentleman.
He is a model of a Cabinet officer. Able, accomplished,
and judicious, capable of doing a given quantity of
work in a specified time, not having made himself or been
made a candidate for the Presidency, he will serve the administration
faithfully, and without aiming to control or
manage it to personal ends; and being in nobody's way for
the succession, with no affiliations formed to secure it to
him, not looked to with any such view by those who present
his name, he will draw on the administration no jealousies
on that score from those who fear passive not less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
active rivals, and will not believe that Presidential ambition,
once entertained, can ever be practically relinquished.</p>

<p>"To the force of all these considerations is opposed
nothing but an alleged repugnance of the South or portions
of it to Genl. Dix's appointment arising from his position
in 1848. I do not suppose Genl. Pierce will be disposed
to, or can listen to, an objection of this nature, and I think
it will be found to have as little real existence as it has
cogency. Mr. Dickinson's friends thought before the last
convention that they should ruin Gov. Marcy by charging
him with having allied with the Barnburners; but it rather
proved an element of strength, and the votes he received
were, notwithstanding, from the extreme South. Our
friends there, as elsewhere, wanted a candidate who could
win. Every man of sense, then, must see now that if the
party would maintain itself, it must do so by the same policy
by which it regained the ascendency. The real difficulty
in respect to the South will be in composing their own dissensions,
in which all sides there will feel infinitely stronger
interest than in any New York question. Such an objection
to Genl. Dix may be entertained by bigotry or the narrowness
of views of some, or more likely it may be the pretence
of men dissatisfied on grounds interesting them personally.
If this pretence be wanting to such, others equally available
will be found.</p>

<p>"Whatever it be, the sooner the administration shall show
that it does not intend to reverse the policy which brought
it into existence the better. Without a prompt, firm, and
decisive course in this respect, we shall have nothing&mdash;from
cabinet minister down to tide-waiter&mdash;but discussions
of past dissensions, which it is the policy and duty of Genl.
Pierce, with all his power as the head of the party, to bury.
It is a case in which boldness is the highest prudence. If
the party cannot be kept large enough to contain all the
great divisions of it which have predominated in powerful
States or sections of the Union, it cannot be kept in the
majority. In the face of the certain results of any other
system, I feel courageous in supporting this, on the principle
on which Moreau said he rendered his soldiers brave&mdash;by
making them fear more to run than to fight.</p>

<p>"Asked the other day by a Hunker friend if I thought
it prudent to take a man of Gen. Dix's class, I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
most certainly to take one such. If past positions on the
slavery question as it existed among Democrats, are to be
the grounds of a classification, it is proper and necessary
to represent the divisions to which Genl. Dix belonged as
well as others. Can it be done anywhere else as well as in
New York? He will be in line with the majority of the
party and the entire government in that State, which the
minority of the party there, if that classification be the
criterion, will still be amply represented in other members
of the cabinet, whereas if he be not taken, and the section
to which he belongs be not represented elsewhere, as we may
presume it will not, the results will be regarded by the
country as a practical exclusion of that interest.</p>

<p>"It seems to be, therefore, desirable to take a man of
Genl. Dix's relations; and to take one or more of the States-rights
Democrats from States in which they stand with a
majority of the party, and to represent the other great interests,
as there will be abundant room to do, in the rest of
the cabinet. A strong administration cannot be made by
combining negations. If it be formed, as it should be, by
men who have a predominant regard to its unity and success,
the more its members have of the confidence and favor
of the interests and States they are respectively taken to
represent, the better. Of course I mean only men of qualifications
and character, and of fitness in these respects and
from their Democratic antecedents&mdash;and the objection to
whom is merely the part they had in the recent Democratic
divisions North and South. Let unfriendly critics, if they
please, call such a cabinet mosaic. If the joiner work be
good, as I believe it may be, and the materials be of the
right general character, I do not care how firm the texture
or strong the colors of the parts. It will dovetail the party
together for a basis on which the administration may stand
securely. Certainly, I assume that in this there will be no
violation of principle and honor to shock the confidence of
the country. Those who think there is, and have acquiesced
thus far, might feel some delicacy that their scruples arise
for the first time when they are asking for themselves and
on this ground a monopoly of the fruits of the wrong. Restitution
to the true owner would be more becoming. If the
party that elected Gen. Pierce be an alliance of those who
cannot honestly act together, it ought to be dissolved; but
if it could honestly unite, there can be no objection to proclaiming
the intention to continue that union, or to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>ing
it out in the most effectual way.</p>

<p>"At the late election, the large popular majorities as
well as large electoral votes were in the great States of
New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Notwithstanding
the clamor about the identification of Scott with Seward,
the South did not do equally well, except in States where
personal antipathies to that interest or personal commitments
of Whig leaders produced systematic defections. No
administration or party can stand without the support of
at least two of the great free States. And the conceded
abandonment at the outset of the canvass of either of the
two largest, especially if it be the first in electoral votes,
and of metropolitan action or opinion, usually loses one or
both of the others. No man has been elected President
against the vote of New York in the six successive elections
since it has been cast unitedly and by the people; nor, indeed,
ever but in a single instance, the circumstances of
which scarcely constitute it an exception. Her vote has
been often an unnecessary addition to his majority&mdash;and
a hopeful contest for it would often enable the other States
to do without her; but it is not easy to measure the force
of her conceded or apprehended loss, representing, as her
population does, elements that affect the equilibrium of so
many other States.</p>

<p>"The interest, headed by Gov. Seward, which nominated
Scott, is a powerful minority in these great States. Carrying
almost the whole Whig party against an existing Whig
administration and the influence of the great Whig leaders,
it may, as an opposition and surviving those leaders, absorb
the third party, now almost holding the balance of power,
without disintegrating itself. It will be likely to try the
experiment. The defection from it last fall, tho' encouraged
by the commanding patronage of the administration
and the name of Mr. Webster, was scarcely more than one&mdash;certainly
not two&mdash;per cent., and was confined to a few
localities. If the previous State elections had not practically
decided the contest, that defection would have been
inconsiderable. Hereafter, not only are these disturbing
causes stilled, but it will have the cementing influence of a
common opposition.</p>

<p>"The characteristics of this interest, in our State politics,
have been profligate jobbing and reckless enterprise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> expenditure.
The only effectual barrier to its predominance
has been in the radicals. They include the prominent men
who, with Wright, Hoffman, and Flagg, fought all our
great financial contests; and a majority of the masses who
maintained their measures, although large numbers of the
latter were&mdash;temporarily, as I believe&mdash;detached by the
divisions of 1848 and bound with the opposite interest about
half of the entire party. While the questions on which
they separated were occasional and temporary, questions
of honest financial policy and administration are ever
present. Indeed, in our time the chief political duty seems
to be to protect the people from plunder under the forms
of legislation and in the abuse of administration.</p>

<p>"On all these questions, as well as doctrines of States'-rights,
free trade, and in most general views of government,
the radicals of New York (as I should have remarked
while speaking of the relations between them and the State-rights
Democrats of the South in a composite cabinet)
sympathize with the radical Democracy of the South; and,
indeed, are the only unflinching coadjutors the latter have
had in New York.</p>

<p>"Agreeing in what is the only safe reliance of constitutional
rights, as well as the cardinal point of the Democratic
faith&mdash;embracing, as each does, the flower of the Democratic
youth, enterprise, and energy in its own region&mdash;without
discussing individual views of the course of either, antecedent
to the general reunion of the party, and admitting, if
you please, that they are somewhat alike in the boldness
with which they maintain their opinions, and repel aggressions
on what they deem to be their rights&mdash;it is obvious
that there are points of sympathy between them which make
it easy and natural for them to fraternize, when out of the
presence of any immediate course of difference, as they did
all through the late Baltimore convention and in its result.</p>

<p>"The radicals of New York include as much talent, courage,
enterprise, and fearless devotion as can be found in
any party. They have the advantage of being, on an average,
half a generation younger than the other. These circumstances,
as well as those I have before mentioned, mark
them as the future of the Democracy of New York. Since
Silas Wright's death they have given their affections to
no providential man. They fell into the support of Genl.
Pierce with alacrity at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> the convention, and with generous
enthusiasm in the canvass, because they recognized in him
qualities in common with those of their lamented leader,
attested as well by the warm regard generated between them
in former years by mutual sympathies, as by the whole
career of the survivor.</p>

<p>"As a matter of mere party calculation, I do not think
it wise, with reference to the reconstitution and reconsolidating
of the party on a comprehensive basis, to leave them
the only large and powerful class not represented in the
cabinet; nor, in undertaking to represent them, to pass
over a statesman of great merit and in all respects unobjectionable,
unless because he is one of their number. The
administration will, I believe, ensure their support by its
principals and measures. But looking to the condition of
domestic politics, in New York and the other great States
on which the strength of the party mainly depends, I do
not think it would be a mistake to add the cordiality that
comes from a sense of equality and reciprocity in party
relations and the energetic and efficient co-operation which
will result. There are other considerations, but my letter
has already reached an unconscionable length, my apology
for which is, that writing my thoughts as they arose while
writing they would not stop, and I could not&mdash;I have set
them down frankly, not without some delicacy, at seeming
so much to advise, but remembering that nobody need follow,
while I would be unwilling to mislead. If I can contribute
any information or suggestion to the general stock
which you have a right to advise, and He whose province it
is to judge must needs gather from all quarters, my end
will be attained. I am too sensible of the difficulties of filling
up a cabinet on principles which seem essential, or
any general principal and at the same time securing the
highest individual fitness, worth and weight and a reasonable
concurrence of our friends in the various localities,&mdash;to
be willing to increase them. A just and firm policy will
solve them, as nearly as is ever attainable in such cases, to
the satisfaction of the country. With the best wishes of
one who may speculate safely because he is without the responsibility
of acting&mdash;and who, except as a citizen, a Democrat,
and a friend of the new administration, has, and can
have, no interest in the result, though not exempt from the
influence of sympathies of opinion and association in attempting
to take a fair view,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A little matter of business, which
called me here for a day, has brought me again in contact
with Gov. Bigler, and his impressions are so strong on a
point I casually mentioned to you in New York that I think
it not improper to repeat his suggestion more formally. It
is that, in case you have decided to take Mr. Campbell<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
into your cabinet, you should, if practicable, put him in
the Interior or Navy, rather than the Post-Office. The Gov.
says the Catholics are very numerous in this State&mdash;enough
to make it probable that, in many instances, they may become
candidates for appointment as postmasters&mdash;and
enough to awaken little neighborhood jealousies respecting
them. He deems it undesirable that Mr. C., as the head of
the department, should be called upon officially to decide
on these cases, and be exposed to the suspicion of appointing
from religious partiality, or to the necessity of doing
injustice in order to avoid that imputation. It is worth
considering whether these views have not more force than
your own observation in the different condition of things
existing in New England would induce you at first to give
them. In expressing them, the Gov. can have no motive
but the welfare of your administration and of the party
here, and his observation of the state of opinion here is
entitled to a consideration. He seems to entertain these
ideas so strongly, and so much to <i>desire that they shall</i> be
presented to you, that I take the liberty of drawing your
attention once more to them;&mdash;not to press them upon you,
but that your mind may pause upon them and take their
exact measure before you conclude the question.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that my engagements will permit me to
be in Washington at the inauguration; but I hope, at any
rate, to have the pleasure of seeing you soon after.</p>

"<i>His Exy. Franklin Pierce</i>."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>We have here a continuation of suggestions which Mr.
Tilden felt called upon to present to President Pierce to
guide him in his dispensation of his patronage in the State
of New York. It makes one sad to think what an opportunity
was lost by this President, and through him by the
country, from his failure to see the wisdom of this advice
and to adopt it. Had Mr. Pierce respected the public
opinion of the State of New York and properly recognized
the political sentiments and sympathies of the majority
there, as he did in the Southern States, the presumption is
that the Nullification party would have been as effectually
disarmed under his administration as it was by President
Jackson a quarter of a century before. Franklin Pierce,
however, was a different man from Andrew Jackson, and
the conditions under which he received his nomination did
not leave him a free agent.</p>

<p>It was only at this stage of Pierce's administration that
Tilden began to indulge in the deplorable error of walking
by sight and not by faith. He did not believe, nor did he
ever again seem to comprehend, that in the slave States all
other questions even the Constitution of our government and
the integrity of our territory, were subordinate throughout
the South to the preservation and extension of slavery;
that every person who ventured publicly to express a doubt
of the wisdom of allowing slavery to extend to the free Territories
was pronounced there a <i>suspect</i>, and was proscribed
as a person who tainted every one who associated with him
politically. The Nullifiers saw, and saw correctly, that the
anti-slavery sentiment could only be resisted in America as
heresy was resisted by Louis XIV. in France&mdash;by crushing
the heretics or driving them from the country. To reason
with Pierce in favor of dispensing his patronage in the
State of New York in accordance with the public opinion
of the State, was as idle as the lambs reasoning with the
wolf in the fable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>The following notes, though without address, were without
doubt prepared by Tilden and addressed to Pierce or to
some one for his perusal. By the paging of the MS., it
appears that thirteen pages, which have not been found, preceded
those which are here submitted to the reader.</p>


<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE ALLOTMENT<br />

[OF OFFICES UNDER THE PIERCE ADMINISTRATION]</h3>

<p>"The Collectorship, the Sub-Treasuryship, and in a less
degree the Naval Office, have State as well as city aspects.
I have therefore set down the Secretary of State and the
foreign missions in connection with them.</p>

<p>"Considered in a State aspect, see how much more the
Hunkers (Hard and Soft) get, in every view of this allotment,
than the Barnburners, who are more than equal in
numbers and power to both of them united.</p>

<p>"Considering the Collectorship singly in that aspect, the
same result is obvious.</p>

<p>"Be not misled by the apparent predominance of the
Hunkers in the city. Up to the moment of the schism in
1848, the Radicals had five-sixths of the masses and nearly
the whole party organization. Their old associates have
been returning to them ever since. In 1851 the Radicals
had a majority of the delegates to the State convention,
and there was but a small majority against them in the
General Committee of that year. At the last election of General
Committee in 1852, they carried a majority; and at the
last trial in the Tammany Society their majority was five
to one. I grant that a large majority of the party went for
Cass in 1848, but I do not think a majority are now in the
leadership of Schell, Sickles, etc., or included in the distinctive
class of Hards. I entertain no doubt whatever, if
the appointments are such as not to affect the question anyway,
the Radicals will remain in permanent possession of
the organization. The truth is that four-fifths of the rank
and file follow the organization, by whichever leaders it is
wielded. All this, however, is matter of opinion; I do not
claim for it the assent of your judgment, although I have
never been known hitherto to over-calculate the strength of
those among whom I belong.</p>

<p>"But permit me to say that this point is below the importance
and dignity of the general question before you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
The most controlling aspects of the case are State aspects
and general aspects. If you vest the most powerful and influential
trust in the State of New York in a politician of
the most vulgar sort&mdash;or narrow views, prospective in all
save the promise by which that trust is secured, a schemer
for personal ends by desperate and fraudulent means, that
almost revolted the party at the last election&mdash;nay, if you
fail to take most ample and certain guaranty against the
predominance of any such influence, in the known, tried,
and elevated character of the man you select, your appointment
cannot fail to be discreditable and disastrous in its
results. You should rest that corner of your administration
on the sense and moral power of the community, by an appointment
which should appeal to them, and draw approval
from all disinterested persons. Do this, and you will rise
above the altitude of mere politicians; and no disaffection
which their disappointments will create can raise a ripple
on the surface.</p>

<p>"There is one other consideration. I have recounted to
you on a former occasion the series of surrenders by the
Radicals to the Softs through which the Union movement of
the New York Democracy has been thus far carried on. I
could not adequately express to you the painful personal
embarrassments by which its recent steps have been marked&mdash;the
embroiling of old personal relations&mdash;and the difficulties
with which it has been achieved. These were our main
motives to ask in the selection of a Cabinet officer from New
York some recognition of the radicals. Again they yielded,
and they have looked forward to the most prominent local
appointment in the State as a case in which what they felt to
be justice&mdash;long deferred&mdash;would be accorded to them. The
impression&mdash;whether well or ill founded&mdash;has existed that
such would be the course of things. I confess that I have
shared in that impression. Instead of there being any cause
for shrinking or hesitation, I think the occasion ought to be
<i>desired</i> to fulfil an expectation so right and reasonable. I
clearly think that it is needed. I know I speak the sentiments
of the strong men among the radicals when I say
that the personal interests, desires, or gratification of Gen.
Dix, or any other man whom they have honored, are as
dust in the balance in the true gravity of this question. I
believe Gen. Dix is the last man who would dissent from
this opinion. At any rate, I take the responsibility of expressing
it in the name of all his supporters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"A clear, conspicuous recognition, in a case in reference
to which expectation has [been] excited, and which concerns
more than the gratification of a single individual, is
what is needed. The controlling men of the radicals in all
parts of the State are independent men&mdash;in condition as in
character. They are weary with debating questions of their
own equality with the rest of their party. They have not
proposed to proscribe anybody. The question has constantly
been whether they should be proscribed. They do not rely
on instructions contrary to the disposition and whole anterior
conduct of the individual intrusted with the power.
Such reliance would be an illusion inconsistent with all ordinary
experience; and a choice which should imply it will
utterly fail of inspiring confidence or producing any valuable
effect.</p>

<p>"The programme should be accomplished to this actual
condition of facts and sentiments.</p>

<p>"It is with a clear sense and earnest feeling outrunning
my power of adequate expression, in the haste in which I
write, that I put you in possession of these ideas. I do so
only because I think I comprehend the case better than
can easily be done from a distance; and because I deem it
important that you should be appraised of the sentiments
of a powerful class on which the success of the administration,
so far as New York is concerned, largely depends. A
desire that you should do what is wise for it and for yourself
is not less my motive than a desire that you should be
just to the class to which I myself belong. I confide entirely
in your disposition to do what is fair and right to all;
and have a grateful sense of the kindness and consideration
with which you have treated me personally. These very
sentiments impel me to address you with earnest frankness
in respect to a matter, a mistake in which cannot, in my
judgment, be easily, if at all, retrieved.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Fowler</span>,&mdash;Yours of yesterday is recd., and
I have read it to Kennedy and Waterbury, who have started
to get letters&mdash;they feel confident that the Mayor will write;
Dix is at Rye, but has written, I think, to Tilden. Havemeyer
writes for nobody this day. I enclose a note of my
own, which, with Marcy friendly, ought to cover ground
enough.</p>

<p>"I yesterday wrote O'Sullivan by Benton&mdash;also Temple;
you will have seen my letters before this. If I had known
last week I could be of service I might have run on. Now
I start for Albany at 1.15, where I have 3 causes amongst
the first 10 in the Court of Appeals, and they now have
a rule that they will not strike off or reserve on the first
day. If I can get away the last of the week I will run on
to Washington, but then I suppose it will be too late. Tallcott
came on with Tilden to Philadelphia, and brings accounts
corresponding with those in your letter. If I had
known exactly how matters stood I would not have alluded
in my letter to Temple to my previous letter to Tilden; if
he has not read the President my letter to him he may strike
out that part, or say that Tilden was afraid the abruptness
of it might not be understood, and so retained it. There
is nothing in either letter that should be misapprehended between
honest men&mdash;the President is entitled to frankness
and plain-dealing, and so are we.</p>

<p>"In regard to my visiting Washington, I see no good I
could do, except to satisfy the President and Govr. Marcy
that we mean to deal with them not only fairly but liberally.
This can as well be done by yourself, Tilden, Richmond,
O'Sullivan, Crosswell, Temple, Cassidy, and any other
friends with whom I have no secrets, and without whom I
should be powerless, if disposed to differ from them. Marcy
must be perfectly aware of this, and I am sure the President
is. I am not surprised to hear from all our friends
that Marcy behaves well&mdash;his natural disposition, old associations,
good sense, and obvious policy all combine to take
him to the side of sound men, and if he is prudent the party
can be made very strong in this State. It is curious, but
true, that I have said from the first that the only fear I
have about him is that he will be too violent on the hard
shells! It is a singular fear for me to have, but it is because
such a course would weaken M.'s influence with
Pierce, and excite sympathy with the hard shells. That
M. would be just to our people I have never doubted si<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>nce
he was selected.</p>

<p>"I left word at Dix's that I had named him for the Collectorship.
I had some conversation with him about it the
other day, and inferred from what he said he would not
decline. On looking over the whole ground this seems to
me the best thing the President can do&mdash;and I think Dix
would be pleased with it. We cannot insist on a mission
for him and the collectorship for a Barnburner. We must
have the latter, and if Dix, after being gazetted to the
Cabinet and to France, should get nothing it would be extremely
awkward and almost ludicrous; this would mortify
me extremely as well as him and his friends. I have been
to see Havemeyer; he <i>says he will not accept</i>. I told him
if he declined we would murder him. But it seems to me
the President should choose between Kelly and Dix; if he
can take Kelly and give Dix a mission that would be best
of all. Write me at Albany, and telegraph if anything
occurs.</p>

<p>The accession of Pierce to the Presidency was soon followed
by the retirement of F. P. Blair, who had edited the
<i>Globe</i>, a semi-official press since the inauguration of President
Jackson, and by the establishment of the <i>Union</i> as
the new administration organ, under the editorship of Mr.
Ritchie, the proprietor of the leading Democratic print in
Virginia. This was the first unmistakable evidence of the
deliberatively proscriptive policy of the new Cabinet.</p>

<p>Mr. Forney, who for many years had been the Washington
correspondent of a Philadelphia print, was assigned to
a prominent command on the skirmish-line of the allied
pro-slavery press. Though not a wit himself, the following
skit will warrant his friends to claim for him the credit of
being once very nearly the cause of wit in another. Its
chief interest to the reader now consists in its glimpses of
many transitory political issues which only live in the daily
press and private correspondence of the period.</p>


<h3>PROSPECTUS OF THE "FORNEY-CATERER"</h3>

<p>"A daily journal will be established in the City of New
York under the title of the <i>Forney-caterer</i>, the first number
of which will be issued Jan. 1st, 1854, or on some other
first of January.</p>

<p>"This journal will profess radically <i>Democratic principles</i>.
Believing in the largest liberty&mdash;especially in
using the public moneys, it will insist on the extension of
that liberty through all the domains of the public treasuries,
national, state, and municipal, as the true idea of <i>Democratic
progress</i>. It will be in favor of <i>free trade</i>, as practically
illustrated in steamship contracts; and will particularly
sustain the <i>Sloo</i> contract, and the assignment thereof
to George Law, Edwin Croswell, Prosper M. Wetmore, and
Marshall O. Roberts; and the <i>Collins</i> contract, which its
editor will also personally advocate in the lobbies of Congress
for a moderate compensation. Opposed to <i>internal
improvement</i> by the general government, it will urge liberal
appropriations of the public funds to any private company
which shall make satisfactory arrangements for grants in
aid of the Pacific Railroad; and will take a small interes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>t
in the purchase by the United States of the property of the
Hudson's Bay Company, should that beneficent measure be
revived with a prospect of success.</p>

<p>"In respect to the foreign policy of this country, it will
be equally explicit. Asserting the honor and dignity of
this great and powerful people, it will uphold the claims
of Messrs. Hargous with firmness, whether against belligerent
or bankrupt nations or against refractory or unconvinced
commissioners.</p>

<p>"Located at the great commercial centre, this journal
will aim to be metropolitan in its character. Not indifferent
to the concerns of sister States, it will take a large
interest in maintaining the Camden &amp; Amboy monopoly and
other domestic institutions, the blessings of which no traveller
ever can pass a sister State without feeling.</p>

<p>"Strangers to the city and State of New York, as the
editor and founder of this journal both are, it cannot be
expected that they should at the outset act without hesitation
in purely local matters. In respect to the offal contract
and the Broadway railroad, and as to the canal lettings
and the timber contracts of John C. Mather, it may
be as well to say that they are, as yet, wholly uncommitted.
They are, however, not altogether unfamiliar with similar
things elsewhere.</p>

<p>"An ample capital has been contributed by gentlemen
who are interested in maintaining the great measures to
which this journal is to be devoted; and no expedient has
been omitted to ensure its success as a business undertaking
in behalf of its stockholders and managers. It will be provided
with editors, reporters, and other <i>attach&eacute;s</i>, enough
to perform all useful services in the lobbies of Congress, of
the State Legislature, and of the city Councils; and with
talent and democracy enough in the editorial rooms to make
good the ordinary wear and tear of character and influence
incident to the other departments of the business.</p>

<p>"As conveyancing will form a large element of the business,
expert legal counsel will be provided in the person of
Mr. D. E. Sickles, who is recommended for this purpose by
his rare skill in <i>taking</i> mortgages.</p>

<p>"Before concluding, it is a painful necessity to advert
to the unhappy divisions of the Democracy of New York,
which it is the main object of this undertaking to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>heal. An
exact impartiality between those who are for preserving
the party and those who are for breaking it up, was intended
to be secured by dividing the ownership of the paper equally
between them, and then putting its absolute editorial control
in the hands of a gentleman whose associations, sympathies,
affiliations, and tendencies are entirely and irresistibly&mdash;with
the latter.</p>

<p>"That equitable and sensible plan having met some unexpected
objection, it has been slightly modified; but it will
nevertheless be carried out as if unchanged. The business
arrangements are most profound and comprehensive. The
proprietors who invest a large capital in the enterprise are
to have no voice in its editorial management, because that
department&mdash;the doctrines it maintains, the degree of its
ability, its consistency, its integrity, in a word, its whole
editorial character&mdash;is not supposed to make any difference
with the subscription-list or advertising of a newspaper.
The modern idea of a complete separation between those
who spend and those who pay is to be carried out more fully
than in any other joint-stock speculation heretofore known;
and gentlemen of first-rate ability in both these departments
have been secured. It is not doubted that the result will
eclipse anything that has gone before it in the newspaper
line. The editor will be paid a double salary for his shares
and the sacrifice he will make in relinquishing a lucrative
place in the House of Representatives, but without prejudice
to his continuance in that post, to which he will be a candidate
for re-election.</p>

<p>"The issue of this journal having been postponed from
the period first announced, an explanation is due to the
public. The paper had become deeply pledged to support
the State ticket to be nominated at the Syracuse convention
and the regular organization of the Democracy of New
York, under the expectation that both would be in <i>adamantine</i>
conformity to the principles herein avowed. The editor
and founder and their associates were assembled in this
city to await the issue of that body; and at the very moment
of the bloody scenes of Syracuse were having recourse to
the private perusal of the riot act, when, lo! they were
themselves thereby incontinently dispersed, and cannot be
at once reassembled.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter was received yesterday. I do
not think there will be any considerable difficulty in respect
to resolutions. The general disposition will be to go to
every reasonable extent to disarm those who are predetermined
to make mischief. The true and only serious difficulty
is to get the convention organized. The plan of those
who are hostile to the union of the party is to have two conventions,
if it be possible to confuse the public mind as to
which really represents the party and its organization. All
the moderation, prudence, and liberality consistent with the
preservation of the convention must be exercised to avoid
a disorganization; or, if that cannot be avoided (as it cannot
be, if any considerable minority are bent on it), to
leave the disorganizers with as little of a case as possible.
The danger is in the large number of contested seats&mdash;real
and pretended. In about half of the cases there is no
shadow of claim on the part of the hard-shell contestants;
and such cases can be multiplied indefinitely, so as to form
with the extreme men in the convention and the contestants
out of it a sufficient number to be a quorum of a separate
body. I think we can stand the large number of these now
known, if the moderate and union Hunkers can be held, as
we anticipate. I have heard from various sources that the
President feels the same solicitude which your letter expresses,
and that he thinks that the defeat of the party here
would revive and reorganize the Whigs all over the country.
In that he is quite right. On the encouragement of a disaster
in this State, the Whig party would spring to new and
full life. It was so in 1837 and in 1846, and in both those
cases the results spread over the whole country. Neither
you nor the President need doubt that we are fully aware of
the peril, both to the party in the Union and in this State;
or that any reasonable effort will be omitted to avert it.</p>

<p>"But we are put to great odds when 30 or 35 of our
districts are neutralized by contested claims, and in all this
part of the State the mass of the patronage of the genl. government
is used most unscrupulously against us, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no truth whatever in the story that Grover<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
voted against or dissented from the resolutions of the late
Syracuse convention. As the question was then taken <i>viva
voce</i> it is foolish to say that any man actually voted for
them unless you happened to see his lips move or distinguished
his voice, but as <i>Grover</i> did <i>not</i> express dissent or
apparently reserve his vote, I suppose he must be deemed
to have concurred in their adoption. I have no doubt that
he did so, for in the caucus the evening before he was
openly in favor of adopting the Baltimore resolutions.
My own knowledge of his sentiments, as expressed before,
correspond with this course on his part. I state this as
matter of fact, because it is fact; and not that I do <i>not</i>
think it idle to expect to silence those clamors in respect to
Mr. Grover. They must have something to say. The convictions
I expressed to you as the true policy in respect to
the collectorship would have been strengthened by subsequent
events if they had not been before so clear and strong.</p>

<p>"The safe issue with Bronson was on the charge that he
has lent his official character and influence to disorganize
the party in this State, and to aid the formation of an organized
opposition to the administration, and has abused
the appointing power entrusted to him to accomplish those
objects both of hostility alike to the Democracy and the
administration. He would be easily convicted of the first
charge by his overt act in taking part with the bolters from
the character of the ticket he sustains and from the declarations
of the body of his associates. Indeed, his practical
position in that respect is already sufficiently recognized by
the general public. The second charge that he had exerted
his official influence and the appointing power to further
the ends of the new combination into which he has openly
entered would be readily believed, and its truth could
be abundantly shown at le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>isure. These charges, if well
founded, as they unquestionably are, are of a character to
justify and, indeed, demand of the administration, by its
duty of self-preservation and its duty to maintain the Democracy
as an organized party, to intervene for objects so
important and so elevated. It can act on such grounds
without loss of dignity, and with a justice that is capable
of triumphant vindication. That action should correspond
with the nature of the case&mdash;the clear legal [obligations]
of the Collector to the President and to the character of the
administration. In my opinion such action is to be performed
only in the exercise of the power of removal. The
efforts of the administration to come to an amicable understanding
with this 'refractory subordinate,' as the <i>Globe</i>
used to say, have all failed hopelessly. Any attempt to
coerce his discretion while retaining him in office is inconsistent
with every attribute which ought to characterize the
action of the administration, as the case now stands, and
will entirely fail of results except to weaken and besmirch
the administration itself.</p>

<p>"The failures to coerce his discretion, even his unfairness
and his infidelity to the policy of the administration in
the distribution of the subordinate appointments, are by
no means the strongest grounds on which to place his removal.
On the contrary, I think it a godsend that he has
furnished other grounds proved to your hands, of impregnable
strength, on which to justify a removal made necessary
by petty wrongs and frauds, but now becomes at once
indispensable at the hands of the administration and capable
of being done without loss of dignity.</p>

<p>"There is still another ground besides those mentioned
where the movement in this State has for its <i>avowed</i> object
to compel the President to remove his Cabinet. This object
is daily manifest through the press and by speeches
and by resolutions. The Collector has taken open part with
this movement, and, while disclaiming these objects, he is
fairly to be held to concur in them, and I presume nobody
has any doubt that he, in fact, does so. He at the same
time holds an office of most power and of more importance
to the administration than any member of the Cabinet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Now is it possible to suppose that if a member of the Cabinet
were taking part in public meetings of men, whose object
was to expel the rest of the Cabinet, the administration
could omit to interfere in the matter without a total loss
of all public respect? The principle that the heads of the
departments should be in relations of harmony and confidence
with the President has been applied as much to the
Collectorship of this port as to the Cabinet offices, and with
at least as much reason. Prudence as well as principle has
always sustained the President through all change of parties
and of individuals in bringing the chief officers of
the government into this harmony with it whenever he has
found them otherwise. These are the grounds on which the
removal of Bronson should be placed, and his unfairness
and infidelity to the policy of the administration in appointments
only incidental as constituting or being part of
a systematic abuse of the appointing power to aid his general
object. This latter should be very incidental.</p>

<p>"It is important that the issue should be made on <i>his</i>
conduct and in its moral, general, and public aspect, and
not on the conduct of the administration in interfering with
his appointments. It is important, in a word, that the administration
should have the <i>affirmative</i> of the issue&mdash;that
it should be charging the attacking party, and not the defending.</p>

<p>"You are now pausing on the edge of a marsh, when you
should be in full march on solid ground, so at least it seems
to me nothing remains but to recover as soon as possible a
firm and strong position.</p>

<p>"If Bronson answers at once, his reply will afford the
occasion for an instant removal.</p>

<p>"In that event, care should be taken, by a well-considered
and powerful article in the <i>Union</i> of a semi-official
character to place the removal on the true grounds&mdash;and
as little as possible on the one by which the correspondence
will probably be used by him and by the Whigs to frame;
and that article should be especially shaped to carry the war
into Africa.</p>

<p>"If, as I fear, Bronson should delay answering in the
knowledge that time lost is all in their favor and against
us, there is one other resource. Let the administration treat
the open avowals of our organized movement to change the
Cabinet, which have been made since the correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
commenced, as a <i>new development</i> of the designs and character
of the movement with which Bronson is implicated,
and as a new offence which calls for immediate action. I
see no difficulty in doing this if the administration is really
earnest for action instead of wishing occasion for temporizing.
Take an affirmative, energetic course, and the details
will work out themselves or be easily brought into conformity
with the broad grounds on which you act. The administration
is perishing by slow disease, the result of indecision
and want of energy. I do not say this because I am
willing to think it is the administration's duty to come up
to any personal wishes or opinions of mine, but I should
be blind if I failed to see the indication of a general and
prevalent public opinion.</p>

<p>"If you had not known me, and I have known you more
than twenty years, and will not think I speak rashly, I
would not speak so frankly, though it is at once the highest
office and best testimony of my friendship to convey early
what is slow and late to reach the ears of men in power.</p>

<p>"The bolting movement in this State would have utterly
failed if it could have been understood at the outset that
this administration were united in discountenancing it. We
should have carried the State, and the President's policy,
wise and right as it was, would have had the double triumph
of carrying at once Georgia and New York, and faction
would have been silenced in and out of Congress. The main
force of the movement here has been the false pretence that
it was favored by a part of them, representations of this
nature being readily believed when made by local leaders
in whom they have confidence. It is idle to say that enough
has been done to counteract this evil, when we are daily
argued with by respectable men to show the contrary.</p>

<p>"But yesterday John Bowdish, of Montezuma, came to
see me on the subject, saying that Thomas B. Mitchell has
assured him that the President and part of the Cabinet
were with the Hards. I heard also from Putnam Co. that
such is the general opinion there. It takes more time than
there is before the election to penetrate the localities with
the truth, and in the mean time men are getting committed
too strongly to change. An unmistakable act at the outset
would have saved all and would do infinite good yet. In
addition to the general considerations respecting the character
of the administration it is desirable [the next three

sheets, and before I read more than one of them the President
came in and interrupted me. The tenor of our conversation
was such that I thought that yr. letter would be

<p>"Bronson's reply is not here, and fears begin to be entertained
that it will not come. To tell you frankly what I
apprehend, I am bound to say that it is possible there will
be no decisive action before election if he does not reply;

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been upon the point of writing
to you for the past two months, but I have been constantly
upon the wing. I regret I was not in this State with
you. I travelled with Messrs. Corning and Delavan over
this region; they were delighted with the crops and the
appearance of the country. The wheat is now nearly gathered.
The quantity and quality are unequalled by any
previous harvest. I think it will give a new tone to affairs
here. Your road is making good progress. I wish it was
done. It will be of great advantage to this section when
the two lines are united. Something will be gained when
the Watertown Road is reached. I hear this will be done
in about ten days. We must make an united effort to get
immigration turned into northern Wisconsin. It now goes
to Iowa and Minnesota. A few of the many thousands coming
to our country from Europe would give life and riches
to the region if they would come here. It is the best country
for them. The Wisconsin roads make great efforts to carry
them over the length of their lines. This carries the immigrants
into other States. You and Mr. Ogden must devise
a plan to correct this.</p>

<p>"I am very much disturbed about Secor's note in the
Merchants' Exchange Bank. My losses have been very great
during the past two years, but I do not like to come short
of high honor in my dealings. I do not think I ought to
pay the note, but I may be wrong. In my doubt, like most
weak-minded men, I have done nothing. I have no right to
trouble you, but I must. I send you a letter from the bank.
My continued absence from home has prevented me from
answering it. This is another offence.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your last letter reached me just as I
was hurrying from the city to fulfil a business engagement
at Lebanon. I partly wrote an answer, while there, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>but left
suddenly, and have not found another opportunity till I
came here for a few days' relaxation and sea-bathing.</p>

<p>"The address of my brother, for which you inquire, is
'Henry A. Tilden, New Lebanon, Columbia Co., N. Y.'</p>

<p>"In my former letter I did not write in respect to politics
because I was very busy, tho' I would not postpone acknowledging
your letter, replying to the business matter it
contained. If that reason had not existed a sufficient one
might have been that I had added nothing to the impressions
I entertained when there was an opportunity of expressing
them more fully than could be done by correspondence.</p>

<p>"The truth is, the moment I return to the routine of my
home-life there are, at present, so many business obligations
and responsibilities claiming my thoughts and exhausting
my activity that I could not, if disposed to do so, give much
habitual attention to politics. It may be that, notwithstanding
my necessary preoccupation, I should not acquiesce in
so practical a retirement if I were able to propose to myself
anything satisfactory which I could see a reasonable prospect
of accomplishing in the present chaotic state of parties
and politics. I have at least reflected enough, and discussed
with others enough, to assure me that I <i>cannot</i>, at present,
propose to myself any such thing.</p>

<p>"My opinions as to the promotion of a fusion party,
whose object should be the restoration of the Missouri Compromise,
have been more fully stated to you in conversation
than they could be here, and have not been weakened by subsequent
reflection. I do not think such a measure of any
practical avail to rescue Kansas and Nebraska from slavery.
Long before it could succeed, in the most sanguine view of
its prospects, their destiny will be settled; and I hope that,
through other agencies, it will be settled favorably. That
being done, there is nothing in the Missouri Compromise
which you or I would wish to have restored. This basis is
not, then, broad or permanent enough to found upon it a
party organization of much power or durability. So, I
think, the public mind will regard the matter. Its action
will be through the emigration societies, and to punish those
whom it holds principally responsible for the breaking up
of the armistice on the slavery question. In these modes
Northern indignation will find complete vent, and will exhaust
itself; and there will be another general calm. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
do I now see any other kindred question able to change this
result.</p>

<p>"In regard to bringing out Col. Benton as a Presidential
candidate. He is very strong with the remnant of the
old veterans of 1834 and 1840, and has great general respect
from the whole country. But I have not changed the
opinions formerly expressed to you in relation to his chances
for 1856. The Democratic organization will run a candidate.
If an organization, including the Northern Whigs,
does the same, I do not see how Col. Benton could get an
electoral vote. Presented, in the first instance, as an independent
candidate, it would require the concentration
upon him of the whole body of the Northern Whigs to give
him any prospect of an election. Whether such a state of
things can arise, it is too early to foresee.</p>

<p>"I greatly regret Col. Benton's defeat in his district,
but cannot say I am much surprised. The Whigs do not
seem to have aided him much. When he ran before, denouncing
all against us, he was the novelty of the day. The
Know-Nothings are that now. If he had been personally
in the canvass it is <i>possible</i> he might have saved himself.</p>

<p>"So far as my observation extends in this part of the
State, a third-party organization, if attempted, would not,
in my judgment, embody a quarter of the force or numbers
our movement did in 1848. I do not know a man who
bore any considerable share of the heat and burden of
that day who would enter <i>actively</i> into a similar campaign
now.</p>

<p>"A few who did comparatively little then might wish
its labors repeated, if themselves exempted. The general
disposition among those most dissatisfied with the course of
things at Washington is disgust, indifference, in some cases
individual opposition, in many independent personal action;
but very little towards organized, affirmative movement.
They expect the Democratic party to be broken down
for the time. They expect the folly of its leaders to inure
to the benefit of the Whigs. Some will look on with indifference;
some will frame a ticket to suit themselves;
some will, perhaps, aid to produce the result which all look
upon as inevitable. Most will expect the Democratic party
to rise again, purified, and to resuming relations with it.
I know of none&mdash;tho' doubtless t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>here are such individuals&mdash;who
intend permanent union with the Whigs. I know
of few who would undertake the formation of a new party
outside of existing organizations. The body of those who
went with us in 1848 will continue within the organization
in which they have since acted."</p>

There is nothing to be achieved in this campaign but

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;After I received your letter, some three
months ago, proposing to confess judgment to the Bk. of
North America for the note due to it, I saw Wm. Henry,
who desired me, if possible, to get the matter postponed, in
order that some different arrangement might be made. I
applied to the bk., and they consented to some further delay,
willing to receive part payment and to renew the residue.
But no plan of that kind having been acted on, the
bk. has been latterly speaking to me every time I meet its
officers, and urge some proceeding so strongly that it cannot
be further delayed.</p>

<p>"The bk. prefers an action which may bring in all the
parties to a confession of judt., and I have had Mr. Green
take the proceedings to save any unnecessary expenses. A
copy of a summons and complaint is sent, with an admission
of service endorsed, which you will please sign and
return.</p>

<p>"At the same time, I cannot forbear expressing my regret
that the matter has not been put in a shape which would
render this course unnecessary. Persuaded in this instance,
not without great reluctance, to violate the rule on which I
habitually and almost without an exception in my whole
life&mdash;act, and which requires me to refuse all endorsements
and suretyships&mdash;I feel that I ought to be prevented from
annoyance from this transaction. If I have submitted and
am submitting to have the trouble and care growing out of
the affairs of the company thrown upon me most disproportionately,
it is simply from a friendly disposition, as
far as I can within any bounds of reason, to see through a
matter in which my friends are involved, and at least to
get it in the best shape I may for them. From the beginning
I resisted connecting myself with the enterprise, into
which I was, nevertheless, drawn; and except, for the considerations
mentioned above, I would dismiss the affair
from my mind forever. Under the circumstances, it is not
strange that I feel that the trouble and care thrown upon
me thro' my regard for the interests of friends should not
be added to by their omission to take care of their confidential
paper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green has recently spent some days in Vermont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in making investigations into the circumstances under which
the Stark Bk. became the owner (if it is so) of your acceptance.
The results are very satisfactory. It will be necessary
to make some additional inquiries of the corresponding
banks. I think we shall be able to show that the Stark
Bank took the paper for antecedent debt which will dispose
of their claims effectually and forever.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Richmond</span>,&mdash;I expected to find you here yesterday
on my return from Lebanon, where I had occasion
to go on Sat. But I suppose you stopped at Albany.</p>

<p>"Since our conversation I have thought over the question
of my running for Atty. Gen. The ground you put it
on&mdash;expediency for our friends, without much prospect of
success to me&mdash;is not one which makes it easy for me to decline.
I could not render that reason or, with such friends
as you, act on it while rendering another. Nor do I, in
truth, care much for any consequences I can conceive as
resulting from defeat. But I am worn from overwork. I
have upon my hands now more than I can do for the next
six months. And if upon the ticket I shall be expected to
share in the canvass more than will be possible, and subjected
to those special annoyances that are peculiar to a candidate
residing in this city. I therefore greatly desire that
you should make up the ticket so as to let me off."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter in answer to mine in respect
to your debt to the Bk. N. A., on which I am endorser,
came to hand. It was not what I supposed from your previous
assurances I had a right to expect, nor what seems to
me just. Whether it be even wise for yourself, I will not
undertake to judge.</p>

<p>"An endorsement made for a man's accommodation is
called <i>confidential</i>, because it is supposed to impart a very
high and sacred obligation to protect the friend who incurs
such a liability in your behalf and for your benefit. It was
a departure from my usual habit and settled rule, wrung
from me by the importunity of friendship. With a good

at your instance, and in the last case with a strong assurance
on your part.</p>

<p>"You must pardon me if I say that I am not advised of
any circumstance that can excuse the failure of so high an
obligation. I have no reason to believe that an <i>absolute inability</i>
exists.</p>

<p>"You allude, in this connection, to other liabilities hanging
over you; by which, I suppose, you mean the claim on
the drafts held by the Stark Bank. I should think that if
anything <i>could</i> add to the obligation to protect me from a
liability on your confidential paper, it would be that I have
been engaged, and am still, with infinite care, labor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"<span class="smcap">Lindenwald</span>, <i>Septr. 1st, '56</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am happy to find that the 'sober
second thought' has brought you to the right conclusion, as
I was quite sure it must do. I may add, too, that I honor
the scruples by which you have been embarrassed. It requires
no small share of moral courage for men of our
antecedents to keep the posts of right and duty against the
influence of such resentments as we have been exposed to.
But it would have been a crying shame to have had a single
link broken in a family so pre-eminently Democratic as
yours has been&mdash;from Dr. and Mrs. Younglove to Sammy.</p>

<p>"We are not only right, but the crisis is, in my judgment,
the most imminent and critical of any we have ever experienced.
That union should so long have been preserved in
a confederacy which contains an element of discord of such
magnitude and of so disturbing a nature as that of slavery,
is a wonder&mdash;more surprising than its dissolution would be.
This has been owing to the fact, I firmly believe, the single
fact that there have always been neutralizing considerations
of sufficient force to maintain party cohesions between men
of the free and slave States. Slavery questions have from
the beginning had more or less to do with our political
contests, but have never before had the effect of dissolving
old party connections and sympathies, and the balance-wheel
has thus been preserved. Now, for the first time in
our history, one side, and that the one in which we reside,
has undertaken to carry an election, including the control
of the Federal government, and against the united wishes
of the other. It has placed itself in a position which, for
the first time cuts itself loose from all hope, if not desire, of
assistance in the slave States. It not only admits that this
is its position, but avows that it is a desirable one. It wishes
to accomplish its mastery by its own unaided ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>m. Now,
it needs no ghost to tell us that one successful effort of this
description will be followed by another, for men have too
much the quality of wild beasts in them to stop the pursuit
when they have once tasted blood, and it would be against
reason and experience to expect a Union, in which political
mastery is so plainly exhibited and organized, to continue.
From this evil we have been saved by the state of parties
which hitherto existed, and to this danger are we exposed
from the new and extraordinary thing which has taken the
place of it.</p>

<p>"Slavery agitation must be eradicated in some way or
another, or our institutions cannot continue in their present
form. I was so indignant against the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise that I could not do justice to the Kansas
Organic Act, as that was the instrument by which the outrage
was perpetrated. But I am now satisfied that if
Mr. Pierce had from the beginning taken the stand he now
seems to be taking, and interfered against all foreign interference
the moment he saw the disposition to interfere,
of which he had at least notice in the movements of the
Missourians, the country would have been saved from the
disgrace to which our institutions have been exposed in the
estimation of the world, Kansas would have been a Territory
so decidedly free as to put an end to attempts to make
it a slave State, the country would have been quiet, the
party united, and he renominated. All that is now wanted
to secure many of the most important of these results is a
rigid and effectual execution of the Kansas Organic Act.
Although I am not a particular admirer of Mr. Buchanan,
I have reasons that satisfy my mind that he will, if elected,
secure to the country this great advantage, and therefore,
and because he is the regular nominee of the party, I should
vote for him. If I did not think so I would not go to the
polls. I do have a very favorable opinion of Col. Fremont
personally, but cannot for a moment doubt, from his
utter want of experience in the affairs of government, and
his inexperience in everything that belongs to it, that he
would, if elected, inevitably be thrown into the hands of
Seward, Greeley, and Weed, and I do not think the difficulties
in Kansas could be brought to anything like a satisfactory
result through such agencies. I, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
think there is the greatest reason to fear that to commit the
power of the government into such hands, at a moment so
critical as the present, would be but 'the beginning of the
end' in regard to the confederacy. There are, I trust, few
Democrats who would like to subject to their control and
to the plundering propensities of their followers, the treasury,
much less the government itself. Our friends who
think they can go with the so-called Republicans this once
and then return, make a dangerous experiment. Their party
has always been a bourne from whence very few Democratic
travellers have ever returned. The reasons for this
are numerous and too obvious to make it necessary to detail
them. They have, therefore, but one of two courses to pursue&mdash;that
is to trust to the Democratic nominee and the
conservative characters of the Democratic party, or to fly
to evils they know not of, save only that except upon a single
point, out of a great many, they cannot even hope for favorable
results.</p>

<p>"But I must stop. This is the first private letter I have
written about the election, and it will probably be the last,
and nothing but my very great respect for yourself and
your race, and my desire to preserve their Democratic consistency,
could have induced me to write this. If it gets
into the newspapers I would leave no stone unturned to
have you punished.</p>

<p>"Upon the subject of your last inquiry, I do not possess
definite knowledge. I believe no final resolution has yet
been come to. But I can tell you nothing encouraging. If
ancient Federalism gain its long-lost ascendancy in that
quarter, as it is so apt to do one time or another, I should
give up judging of character.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A bill has been sent to some member
of the city delegation by Mr. Green (who is absent for a
few days), the nature and objects of which I wish to explain
to you.</p>

<p>"Vessels were formerly repaired by careening them,
afterwards by drawing alongside or suspending to them
stages; afterwards by drawing them out on ways. The railway,
acting by hydraulic force, was the next mode by which
repairs were effected. Some 16 to 20 years ago floating
docks were invented and brought into use. They have
gradually superseded all other modes; and vessels have increased
in their size, until there are now no other means of
coppering or repairing them than these floating docks.</p>

<p>"Of their utility and indispensable necessity there is no
question. The commerce of this port could not get on without
them.</p>

<p>"They have, since their first invention, been located in
the waters of the East River, adjacent to the 7th Ward.
The propriety and legality of their use of the basins (with
the consent of the parties entitled to receive wharfage) has
never been disputed until last year, when some parties proceeded
against them on the ground that they are unlawful
obstructions of the public waters.</p>

<p>"Judge Roosevelt made a decision which, if well founded,
goes the length of holding that this commercial use cannot
be lawfully carried on or enjoyed in any of the slips, or at
any wharf or pier of the city, and in the opinion which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
pronounced on that occasion he recommended an application
to the Legislature to supply the technical defect of the law.</p>

<p>"This is the object of the bill. It legalizes the use, with
the consent of the pier and wharf owners, and subject to the
power of the Common Council to regulate and fix the location.</p>

<p>"The bill is right in all respects. I take great interest
in its passage, in behalf of the company I represent, the
stockholders of which are owners or consignees of two-thirds
of all the shipping which comes to this port, as well as on
account of the general commercial interest. I will regard
your aid as a personal favor.</p>

<p>"If your curiosity to know the 'whys and wherefores'
of our defeat is not displaced by some later topic, I will
drop you a hint or two towards a theory.</p>

<p>"A modern invention practised in Tammany Hall is
for the genl. Committee to dispense with primary elections.
It was introduced by Wood and has continued since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> he was
driven out. The effect of two or three years' practice under
the system has been to break off relations between that body
and the masses in the wards. It was no longer necessary
for the one committeeman and his four dummies, who represented
a ward in the committee, to keep up a vital party
in his ward. The ward committees fell into disuse, and in
some cases what remained of them were in hostile hands.
Meanwhile the outsiders felt that they had no chance, and
antagonisms were multiplied in all the captains of tens and
fifties&mdash;the new men, the active elements of fresh ambition.
The chiefs of the general committee became totally bankrupt,
were split into two parties&mdash;about equal&mdash;had been
occupied for months in a scuffle for the assets, the real value
of which they did not see till the last moment. In a party
twice as large as any it had to contend with, and therefore
tending to division&mdash;with its central organization in this
condition, and its ward all run out&mdash;Wood hung up his
sign over the outsiders. He made local organizations among
them; worked at it assiduously for two years. When I
stepped inside the ring and took a view I thought that in
some wards, each having once and half as many people as
your county contains, we should scarcely have machinery
enough to run our ticket with&mdash;the 11th, for instance. We
had less than two weeks to get up our organization, beginning
anew&mdash;in a bad state of local nominations, many of
the candidates running on both tickets and being really
against us. Wood had gained the lower stratum of the Irish,
combined many special interests, and at last had the aid of
the jobbing Republicans, two of whom voted for him to
every one of the other class for Havemeyer. Then the
<i>Tribune</i>, in <i>bad</i> faith, and the <i>Post</i> in good faith, succeeded
in making the impression that the way to beat Wood was to
vote for Opdyke; and not only kept the moderate Republicans
to him, but drew many quiet citizens who preferred
Havemeyer, but were most anxious to beat Wood.</p>

<p>"In truth, the leaders of the Republican party and Wood
were in perfect concert, as they are partners in the gigantic
schemes of plunder, which will presently appear.</p>

<p>"Mr. Havemeyer polled a prodigious vote of the business
classes and of the silent people, but not enough to supply
the defects of the organization which, in my judgment,
did not by its own strength give him 15,000 votes.</p>

<p>"Enough of this. I should not have gone over the ground
except for the curiosity you expressed&mdash;that what ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>peared
to be an immense public opinion was ineffectual. It is a
public opinion with a party, and not without, that sweeps
the stakes.</p>

<p>"For myself, while I am quite aware how different is
the <i>prestige</i> of success from defeat, and how great was the
part which might have been attempted in reconstructing the
administration of the government of the city, I cannot but
feel more comfortable as I am. The proper duties of the
office are one thing. A joint tenancy in the administration
of a city like this (if you really attempt to do anything);
a reconstruction of its government, which must be made from
the very foundation, in order even to palliate existing evils,
is a different matter. Overworn as I am with some heavy
engagements, from which I cannot retire, yet uncompleted&mdash;and
some heavy cares unrelieved&mdash;I could not help seeing
the burden more than anything else. This may have
been morbid. A little more strength and health might have
dispelled it. But it enables me to accept the result with a
sense that a great trouble is off my mind, and leaves no personal
regret to mingle with the disgust I feel at Wood's
election, and the disappointment and injury to our friends.
At present, I am content to live from hand to mouth, and
take no thought for the morrow.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding your invitation to discuss the matter,
I feel some excuse necessary for a letter that has grown so
long and so personal.</p>

comfort and progress in the work which enlivens your retirement,

rescue and reorganization of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne &amp;
Chicago Railroad during the early days of the Civil War,
and transforming it from a bankrupt corporation into one
of the most prosperous highways on this continent. It is

<h3>TILDEN TO W. H. SWAYNE</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">"<span class="smcap">Feb.</span> <i>10, 1860</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It being designed, if possible, to provide
for a reorganization of the Pittsburg, F. W. and Chicago
R. R. Co. during the present year, such legislation as
is necessary should be obtained at the present sessions of the
Legislatures of Penn. and Ohio. That would be expedient
even if we were to wait for legislation in Indiana and Illinois
until next winter. But I do not think it is necessary
so to wait. I suppose that a corporation created by one of
the States in which the road is situate, if endowed by the
law of its creation with the capacity to exercise its functions
in the other States, may hold and operate the road in those
States if the sovereigns there will allow it to do so. I suppose
that express permission is not necessary. It may do
so on the principle of comity, unless prohibited by the legislation
or declared public policy of those States. It may still
be prudent to get the assent of those States declared legislatively.
The act which governs the constitution of the
corporation may be obtained in Penn. That will avoid any
question as to the operation of the clause of your constitution
imposing a personal liability upon stockholders. In
Indiana there is a general law adequate to enable us to reorganize
a corporation of that State. Its Legislature, like
that of Illinois, does not meet till next year. There is
nothing in the statutes or decisions of Illinois to prevent a
corporation of Penn. or Indiana from holding and operating
a railroad in Illinois. I presume there is not in Ohio, but
that I have not investigated, as it is wiser to have an act of
recognition. In Penn. the statutes of <i>mortmain</i> exist by
judicial adoption, and no foreign corporation can hold real
estate there without express permission.</p>

<p>"We propose, then, immediately to get what we can, viz.,
a parent act from Penn. and an act of recognition from Ohio.</p>

<p>"The act for Penn. was finally agreed upon between <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Mr.
Campbell and me yesterday, and was taken by Mr. Ogden
to Mr. Cass to be passed. I will send you a copy as soon
as I get one.</p>

<p>"I have drawn and send herewith what I deem to be a
suggestion towards the bill proper to be passed by your
Legislature.</p>

<p>"There may be a disposition to add some provision bringing
the corporation under the jurisdiction of Ohio. You
must be careful that nothing of this kind is done in such
general terms as to bring the stockholders under the operation
of your Constitution or laws as to personal liability.</p>

<p>"I would like to have you revise this bill and put it in
motion. We must rely on you and Judge Thompson to have
it passed. It would be prudent to urge it forward as fast
as possible.</p>

<p>"I enclose some passages cut from my points in a recent
case, which touch on the questions I have alluded to.</p>

<p>"It is very desirable that Mr. Stansbery's bill, converted
into a general form, or some other bill applicable to all railroad
corporations in your State needing reconstruction,
should pass. I trust you and Thurman will aid in effecting
such a result. There are plenty more of cases needing your
doctoring. I regret that I must write in so much haste. I
have to leave here in half an hour, having just returned from
Phil.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ogden is to-day in Pittsburg with authority to have
a settlement effected if it can be.</p>

<p>"Do me the favor to let me have your views as soon as
possible.</p>

<h3>S. J. TILDEN TO M. VAN BUREN&mdash;UNFINISHED</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Feb. 21st, 1860</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My mind has often turned to your letter,
which I am some six weeks in arrears in answering.
But I have in that time been three times called to Philadelphia,
and once to Lebanon by the extreme illness of my
mother and sister; and, altogether, have had my hands full.
I am much obliged by the kind expressions of your letter,
as well as the friendly interest you have taken in me.</p>

<p>"In respect to the subject which you incidentally mentioned
in your letter, I do not think that my private business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
affords the elements of a desirable combination between
John V. B. and myself.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It furnishes few occasions which
would give scope to his powers, less, perhaps, than ought
to be availed of even by me; but it and other cares occupy
me too much to leave any room for the ambition of collecting
the materials, or constructing a business of a different
character. I content myself each day with what my hands
find to do. I have not been very fortunate in deputizing
such business as I have generally had. It may be because
the things which come to me are usually complex and difficult,
or because I am exacting as to the mode in which my
clients are served."</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mr. Tilden's letter to ex-President
Van Buren, assigning his reasons for declining to enter
into a partnership with his son John, is incomplete. A more
impracticable union for business purposes than such a partnership
would have yielded can hardly be conceived. It is
probable that the original of this letter to Mr. Tilden may
be found among the collected papers of Mr. Van Buren,
which have recently been presented to the Library of Congress,
unless it was destroyed immediately upon its receipt,
which is not unlikely.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;You politely offer to publish in your
columns a speech of mine which you seem to think was not
adequately developed at the Cooper Institute last evening,
and you add that my friends among your readers 'would
be glad to know how' I 'have reasoned' myself into the
associations in which I stand on the Presidential question.</p>

<p>"If I had a speech already written I would at once avail
myself of the opportunity of submitting my views on public
affairs to a mass of readers, among which are many cultivated
intellects and some friends of my earlier years who,
I respectfully say I think, are widely and dangerously
wrong in their present political action. I have but the intervals
of exhausting daily engagements in which to prepare
a speech; but if after this explanation your offer shall
continue open, I will endeavor within the next few days
to write out in a condensed form what I think ought to be
said, not to my friends only, but to all our citizens touching
the present state of the country. If, indeed, it can be justly
said that I have helped to lead the <i>Evening Post</i> into any
'heresies,' I acknowledge the sacred duty of showing it a
'decent way out' of them.</p>

<p>"With much consideration, I remain,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23.5em;">"<span class="smcap">S. J. Tilden.</span>"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Though we invited Mr. Tilden to give us the speech
which he proposed to address to his spectators&mdash;they would
not permit him to call them his audience&mdash;at the Cooper
Institute, we are quite willing to extend the courtesy to anything
he may choose to offer us in which he thinks the public
has an interest. The readers of the <i>Evening Post</i> know
much better than the crowd he tried to address at the Cooper
Institute that Mr. Tilden never writes or speaks without
having something to say worth hearing, though they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
not lately been unfortunate enough to agree with him on
Federal politics."</p>

<p>The foregoing letter, with the editorial comment which
follows it, appeared in the <i>Evening Post</i> October 10, 1860.</p>

<p>The occasion which provoked it was the following account,
which appeared a day or two previous in the <i>Evening
Post</i>, of a meeting at the Cooper Union of malcontents,
having little in common to unite them but their hostility to
the party which had nominated Abraham Lincoln for President.
They were mostly the unaccounted-for <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the
old Whig party, who tried to disguise themselves by taking
the name of "Merchants of New York." Mr. Tilden was
invited to speak, but this motley audience did not care to
listen long to so prominent a political partisan of Jackson
and Van Buren, who had also been the most formidable
critic of all Whig measures during all their successive administrations:</p>


<h3>"THE TREMENDOUS DEMONSTRATION</h3>

<p>"The 'Dry-Goods party,' as by general consent the fusionists
have come to be designated, held what they called a
'Union meeting' last night at the Cooper Institute. They
did not meet at Tammany Hall, for obvious reasons, though
it must have made some of the gentlemen who contributed
towards the expense of the entertainment feel a little queer
when they found themselves associating politically with a
class of men who could not be persuaded to put a foot inside
of the old Wigwam. It has been observed that political
parties, as they decline in strength, lengthen the list of
officers supposed to officiate at their public gatherings, just
as the shadows of mountains lengthen as the sun goes down.
The Dry-Goods party did not attempt to be an exception;
on the contrary, they seem to have made all of their party
vice-presidents that they did not make president and secretaries.
In looking over the list of gentlemen who figure on
this occasion, we could not but be struck with what Clay
called the 'mutability of all human opinion.' It seemed
as if the milky portion of the old barn-burning party of '48
which had soured from the effects of Republican thunder,
had been specially served up for the public ent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ertainment.
There was Dix, who ran for Governor with Van Buren in
1848 against Cass, nominated for chairman by Wilson G.
Hunt, largely in the dry-goods line, who supported Van
Buren and free soil as zealously and liberally as he now
supports Breckinridge, Douglas, Bell, Sam &amp; Co.</p>

<p>"Our old friend Tilden, who stood at the wheel during all
those troublous times; who was one of the counsel for the
Barnburners in the Baltimore convention of 1848, and who
helped to lead the <i>Evening Post</i> into all its free-soil heresies
without ever showing it any decent way out of them,
offered the resolutions and made a short speech. It would
have been longer, but the audience wished to hear Wood.
Either Wood or a song they must have, and so Mr. Tilden
retired with his speech just as good as new, and, as it appeared,
too good for his audience, that they might hear a
song from a Mr. Cosgrove, Wood being returned by the
officer 'not found.' The preference for Wood is explained,
perhaps, by the fact that the first vice-president, W. B.
Astor, was one of the ten or dozen gentlemen who certified
to Mayor Wood's character when a candidate a second time
for the '<i>mayorality</i>'&mdash;as Mr. Wood is in the habit of
spelling the dignity he at present enjoys&mdash;and who recommended
him warmly to the suffrages of the people. All
the rest of the gentlemen who signed that 'character,'
Moses Taylor, M. Aspinwall, the Browns, etc., figure also
among the vice-presidents, and it is not strange, therefore,
that a meeting thus officered should prefer a speech from
Fernando Wood to a speech from Samuel J. Tilden.</p>

<p>"Then there was Henry Grinnell, who paid liberally
towards raising the standard of rebellion at the park meeting,
held shortly after the nomination of Cass, in 1848,
and whose name was freely used by the Barnburners until
about the time that the Union-saving steamship companies
began to be incorporated and subsidized by Congress. Since
then he has had little or no interest in anything North, this
side of the Arctic circle.</p>

<p>"John Cochrane, Dan Norris, Henry Eveson, William
F. Havemeyer, Stephen Cambreleng, Charles A. Secor,
Myndert Van Schaick, whom, to his great disappointment,
the Barnburners failed to elect Mayor of the city before
the days of fusion, T. B. Tappen, John Van Buren, A. B.
Conger, Addison Gardiner, etc., etc., make up the list of
distinguished Barnburners of the milky sort who have
'turned,' and now form the cheesy pillars and architrav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>e
of the Dry-Goods party.</p>

<p>"The speakers for the evening were James W. Gerard
and Charles O'Conor, two of our ablest lawyers, skilled to
make the worse appear the better reason, and, from long
professional training, about as much at home on one side of
a question as another. As neither of these gentlemen were
in good standing with the old Democratic party, the first
being an old Whig and the other a fractious and crockery-breaking
independent, they were listened to with patience
by an assembly conspicuously impatient of anything savoring
of old-fashioned Democracy.</p>

<p>"What effect the bringing together such a crowd of
officers for such a thin display of speakers will have upon
the dry-goods market will doubtless appear in the column
where such reports are usually chronicled; what effect it
will have on the Pennsylvania election will appear by the
returns in to-morrow's <i>Evening Post</i>; what effect it will
have upon the vote of this State is of no sort of consequence,
for we were sure of a large majority before it was held,
and of course we may reasonably expect a larger majority
now.</p>

<p>"We are sorry about Mr. Tilden's speech. We have no
doubt it was a good one, and as we are the friends of free
speech we will publish it cheerfully in the <i>Evening Post</i>
if he will give us the opportunity. It will reach a great
many more of his friends through our columns than stood
within the reach of his voice, and they will all be glad to
know by what process so clever a man has reasoned himself
into such bad company."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;Newell tells me that you are preparing
a reply to the <i>Post's</i> appeal to be 'shown the way out.'
Do so; and it will give me a chance to write an editorial,
which I intended and postponed till the occasion passed by.
I enclose a reply to an assault upon our consistency, the last
half of which is <i>apropos</i> to the <i>Post's</i> inquiry. I am afraid
your committee of fifteen will do more harm than good&mdash;as
usual. You recollect how the Castle Garden movement
defeated Seymour and elected Church, reversing its inte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>nded
effect, and how the Fifth Avenue movement of last year
paralyzed us? Let it go, however, with the other blunders.</p>

<p>"What I write to you about is to say that I intend to
come down to New York on the 7th proxo. and consult you
in regard to a project which O&mdash;&mdash; and I have long discussed&mdash;establishing
a New York daily. We can readily get
$60,000 (or more) for shares, and from a few men. I can
name Plumb, DeWolf, Johnson (of Oswego), Ross&mdash;besides
Richmond, Cagger, Corning, Kelly, etc. We could
<i>add</i> what an establishment here is worth, $40,000 or
$50,000. The sum could be increased, and all subscribed
outside of New York. It is not for help (to ask you 'to
go round with a paper,' as your party friends generally do),
but simply for advice. Wesley, the banker, once proposed
to sell me some of his interest in the <i>Times</i> if I would go
in there. This is <i>entre nous</i>, and I allude to it only to explain
why I am going to consult him, as well as you.</p>

<p>"If we could buy the <i>World</i>, the <i>Express</i>, or the <i>Post</i>,
that would make the best beginning. If we established the
New York <i>Argus</i> or <i>The Age</i> we could start with a larger
subscription and in better organization than any two other
persons. Of course we would have to go to great expense,
employ many hands and heads, and meet a fearful competition.
But neither of us are without experience, and we
have regarded the question on all sides. There must be, and
there will be, a Democratic organ in New York. Who is
to control it? In the transitive state of politics, 'that is
the question.' There's a vast volume of Democratic patronage
going to waste in the city, and still more beyond it.
We send out 40,000 weekly papers from Albany, and in less
than a year could raise it to 200,000 if we were in New
York. That is as much as Greeley has for his <i>Tribune</i>, and
that is the source of its influence.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of ability in New York that could be
called in. What is wanted is conduct&mdash;a policy, prudence,
independence&mdash;for the political part. For the business part
we want competent men&mdash;an association, if possible, with
a great publishing house, in order to avail ourselves of
literary talent, not allowing it, however, to be our publisher.
Commercial and other reporters, and enough literary talent
to supply a daily <i>feuilleton</i>; for we must call on the aid of
fiction, as the Paris papers do, and so gratify a taste which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
is stronger here than anywhere else. I would commence by
getting Hawthorne or some writer of equal talent to furnish
a novel, which might be republished afterwards in a volume,
and which would thus pay. To do this, we should want a
paper like the <i>World</i>. We will reverse the wish of Archimedes:
give us the <i>World</i>, and we will find the lever to
move it.</p>

<p>"But I intend to ask your advice, not to forestall it. Until
I see you, which will be after the November triumph, I
remain</p>

<p>"When Wood was elected by Greeley's agency, I made
up my mind that he would administer retributive justice
upon G. &amp; Co. by some stupendous organization of the canvassers.
But you have an honest vote of 100,000. The
Republicans are not entitled to more than 30,000 of this.
Give us 40,000, and we will carry the State. Organize&mdash;make

preaches moderation and forbearance&mdash;who endeavors to

folly, and it looks very much as if the teaching was begun.
I look upon Mr. Seward as the most mischievous man now

not the apology of a fervid temperament and rash blood.
His words are the more dangerous, because so deliberately
uttered. But I rejoice that you have written the letter, and
that so many patriotic and judicious men have been willing
to speak and write as you have done. Always anticipating
the election of Lincoln, I have been in the habit of saying
to our friends that the value and importance of the Union

I think I was a true prophet. If the country is to be safely

it will be by the agency and instrumentality of the Union

<h3>TILDEN TO W. H. SWAYNE ON THE PROCURING A CHARTER
FROM THE STATE OF OHIO FOR THE PITTSBURG,
FORT WAYNE &amp; CHICAGO RAILROAD</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">"<i>Dec. 6, 1860.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Two modes of investing the future owners
of the P. F. W. H. R.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> with a corporate character within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the State of Ohio have been suggested.</p>

<p>"1. One is to make them a corporation of the State of
Ohio&mdash;by creating them a new corporation, or by continuing
to them the old corporate franchise.</p>

<p>"I understand Mr. Stanbery and Mr. Hunter to propose
the latter method. By providing for the transfer of the existing
franchise to be a corporation by a general law, they
avoid the constitutional provision that 'the general assembly
shall pass no special act conferring corporate powers.'
They think, also, that by preserving the identity of the existing
franchise they can avoid the operation of the constitutional
provision 'that in all cases each stockholder shall
be liable over and above the stock by him or her owned, and
any amount unpaid thereon, to a further sum, at least equal
in amount to such stock,' upon the ground that the provision
is not retractive, and was established subsequently to existence
of this corporation. They think, also, that although
the identity of the corporation will be preserved, it can be
discharged from liability for the debts and contracts which
it has made. If it should be found to be liable for those
debts and contracts, the main object of the reorganization
would fail.</p>

<p>"2. The other mode is to make the future owners a corporation
of Pennsylvania or Illinois, and to enable that
corporation to hold, maintain, and operate the part of the
road which is situate in Ohio, without being a corporation
of the State of Ohio.</p>

<p>"To enable a Pennsylvania corporation, for instance, to
hold, maintain, and operate the part of the road situate in
Ohio two things are necessary:</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, that it should be endowed by the law of its creation
(which would be the act of Pennsylvania creating it),
with capacity to hold, maintain, and operate the part of the
said road which is situate within Ohio.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, that it should have the consent, implied or
expressed, of the State of Ohio to the exercise within that
State of its powers to hold, maintain, and operate the part
of the railroad situate within that State.</p>

<p>"Such consent in this case will be implied, unless the
implication is negatived by express legislative declaration
of the public policy of the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"As the laws of Ohio allow an individual purchaser to
hold, maintain, and operate the railroad&mdash;which individual
might be a non-resident&mdash;and as there is no policy established
by legislation or by a judicial construction to disable
a corporation of another State having the requisite capacity
from doing so, the case comes clearly within the principle
on which nearly all the acts of corporations in other States
than those of their creation are sustained by the courts as
lawful.</p>

<p>"The rights of the State of Ohio are not violated; for
it is by her consent that these powers will be exercised within
her dominion. That consent could have been withheld. I
do not say that it might not be withdrawn by legislation,
not so as to divest rights of property which accrued while
it existed, but so as to produce inconvenient consequences
to the tenure of the corporators: nor will I advert to the fact
that a vast number of transactions are daily carried on in
some of the States by corporations of other States, subject
to the same possibility, or that in some States, as in New
York, most corporations exist subject to full legislative
power to repeal the act conferring the franchise.</p>

<p>"For I have not doubted&mdash;I have uniformly expressed
the opinion that in a case of the peculiar nature and vast
importance of the present it is wise to obtain an express
consent.</p>

<p>"Shall that consent be given by special act or general
law? Would it have any effect on the extent of the liability
of the corporations?</p>

<p>"The essence of the corporate character is that several
individuals are united in one body&mdash;enabled to exist and
act as an artificial person created by law, the members of
which can change without impairing the identity of that
body of person.</p>

<p>"The code of regulations, according to which it exists
and acts, which fix its <i>modus</i> is incidental to that creation.</p>

<p>"Its other powers, which may be and often are possessed
and exercised by natural persons, are not, strictly speaking,
corporate powers, such, for instance, as making discounts,
granting insurances, operating railroads; there is nothing
in the nature of these powers which necessarily confines them
to corporations. They are not of the essence or of the incidents
of the corporate character. I think the prohibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the Ohio Constitution that 'the general assembly shall
pass no special act conferring corporate powers' is a mere
paraphrase of the prohibition of the New York Constitution,
contained in the following provision: Corporations may
be formed under general laws, <i>but shall not be created by</i>
special act, etc. The next clause of the Ohio Constitution
provides that 'corporations' may be formed under general
laws.</p>

<p>"The provision was, in the main, copied from the Constitution
of New York. The modification of details accounts
for the change in the collocation.</p>

<p>"In a cursory review of the discussions in the Ohio convention
I see no trace that anything further was intended
by the prohibition than to interdict the creation of corporations
by special acts.</p>

<p>"That construction accords with the true meaning of the
words 'corporate powers,' which is powers essential or
incident to the nature of the artificial being created
by law&mdash;such as the power to take a common name,
to have corporate succession, to contract and be contracted
with, and to sue and be sued as one person, etc. These are
properly corporate powers. It is true the words are sometimes
used to include all the powers which the particular
corporation possesses; but that is a loose and inaccurate
use.</p>

<p>"I think that the correct interpretation of the publication
is that it simply forbids the creation of a corporation
by a special act of incorporation&mdash;nothing more. It does
not forbid an act operating to enlarge, modify, or restrict
the rights of an existing corporation, any more than it does
a similar act in respect to a natural person in a like case.
Still less does it forbid such legislation in respect to a foreign
corporation. It is enough for the present case to say
that the clause does not prohibit a legislative recognition or
an express sanction of an existing comity of the State in
favor of an existing corporation of another State.</p>

<p>"1. I am, therefore, of opinion that a special act declaring
the assent of the State of Ohio to the exercise within that
State of all the powers necessary for a beneficial use of the
Pittsburg, F. W. &amp; Chicago Railroad by a corporation of
Pennsylvania or Illinois, which should have become the
owner of the part of such railroad situate within the State
of Ohio, would be valid and effectual.</p>

<p>"A general law would, of course, be somewhat preferable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
as it would avoid this question. If it is certainly attainable,
I would seek our legislation in that form.</p>

<p>"But I foresee the possibility that it might excite more
jealousy than a special act, because its full application and
use cannot be certainly anticipated. I foresee, also, the possibility
that it may affect special cases of existing interest,
prejudice, or passion, of which I am ignorant.</p>

<p>"In the first section of a draft of a general law which I
have hastily made at a suggestion, I have tried to avoid the
first of these two objections by limiting the cases to which
the law applies.</p>

<p>"1. An existing railroad.</p>

<p>"2. Partly situate in Ohio and partly in some adjacent
State.</p>

<p>"3. Sold under an existing lien.</p>

<p>"4. Acquired by a corporation of another State in which
another part of the same railroad is situate.</p>

<p>"5. Such corporation acquiring the part of the railroad
situate in that other State.</p>

<p>"6. Of course, such corporation having the capacity to
take and operate the part situate in Ohio.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may have put in more limitations than are
necessary.</p>

<p>"Whether the measure will run foul of any other interest
can be better judged of by men conversant with the state of
affairs in Ohio and in its legislation.</p>

<p>"The general law, as proposed, is not more liberal than
the existing consolidation act of Ohio. We ought to be able
to obtain it. If there is a strong probability that we cannot,
we ought to obtain a special act of a similar nature, applicable
only to our particular railroad.</p>

<p>"2. The advantage of not making the corporation a creation
of the State of Ohio is that it certainly and unquestionably
avoids this double liability of the corporators imposed
by the Constitution of that State.</p>

<p>"The degree of liability to which the individual corporators
shall be subject is a part of the code of regulations
specifying the mode and conditions of the existence and
action of the artificial being. Sometimes it is nothing beyond
the stock paid in. Sometimes, as by the Ohio Constitution,
it is a limited amount beyond the stock paid in; sometimes
it is absolute, as in the case of partners. It is not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the essence of corporations&mdash;it is a regulation imposed by
the sovereign who creates the artificial being an incident to
the particular corporation. Nobody but that creator could
impose such a regulation. The most any other State could
do would be to refuse its comity to a corporation until it
should get the regulation imposed by the lawful authority
of the State of its creation.</p>

<p>"Besides, the provisions of the Constitution of Ohio applies
only to corporations created by or under the laws of
that State. It does not purport to operate on corporations
of other States transacting business in Ohio under the comity
of its sovereign.</p>

<p>"3. In respect to the general act proposed by Mr. Stanbery
and Mr. Hunter, I think they should prepare it and
that we should co-operate in procuring its passage. It would
be open to our choice if on consultation we should prefer
to act under it; and it would be useful in other cases. My
idea originally was to have that general law and a special
act for the Pittsburg, F. W., C. R. R. If we change
the latter to a general law, it makes two of that character;
but I do not see any objection if we can get them both
passed.</p>

<p>"I should like to have a copy of the draft of such an act
as Mr. Stanbery and Mr. Hunter propose.</p>

<p>"The draft of a general act which I send contains provisions
which ought to be considered as consulted upon. I
have prepared them without, perhaps, sufficient study of
your laws on the subject, and without knowing the temper of
your Legislature.</p>

<p>"In some particulars they must be regarded as mere suggestions.
Consider&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. The clause of Sec. 1, subjecting the company in respect
to its management of the part of the railroad to the
duties and regulations imposed by your general laws&mdash;whether
there is any provision which should be accepted,
whether this clause ought to be made more stringent in
order to be satisfactory to your Legislature. But care should
be taken not to use expressions which could include the personal
liability provisions of the Ohio Constitution and
laws.</p>

<p>"2. The clause of the same section subjects it to be&mdash;</p>

<p>"Section 2 is intended to give the same power as to mortgaging
the rolling stock, etc., which is contained in the
Pennsylvania act. I do not think this ought to be objected
to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Section 3 is an adaptation of a clause proposed last
summer.</p>

<p>"I cannot send a fair copy of the special act without
losing a mail. The general one is sufficient as a basis of
consideration and consultation.</p>

<p>"I would like to have you consider the matter, and must
contrive some way to meet in consultation.</p>

<p>"I address this letter to you, though its contents are for
Mr. Stanbery, Mr. Hunter, and Judge Sherman, to whom
I pray you to offer my best respects.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO W. B. OGDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Dec. 17, 1860</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As you leave in the morning to return
to Chicago, I seize a few moments this evening to submit
to you some suggestions as to the present crisis in the affairs
of our country. I know you have no personal aspirations;
that you are exempt from the blinding and misleading influence
of active partisanship; that your disposition is equitable;
that you have no motive but the public good&mdash;no interest
except in common with all patriotic citizens; and that,
far better than most men, you understand that there is usually
another side to a controversy than 'our side.'</p>

<p>"Your situation may enable you to be of great service to
your country and to mankind, and of not less service to a
gentleman who to-day occupies a more important and responsible
position than has been the fortune of any other
of his generation. Of course I allude to Mr. Lincoln. His
patriotism I do not doubt. The impression he made on me,
upon two occasions when I casually met him, was that of a
frank, genial, warm-hearted man. In the actual duties of
the Presidency he cannot but take conservative views. No
man can have a motive so strong and yet so noble to prevent
his own name from closing, amid public sorrow and shame,
the illustrious roll of American Presidents which began
with Washington.</p>

<p>"It must be his renown or his calamity to dec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ide whether
he shall be the Chief Magistrate of a whole country or of
half a country. Providence has cast upon him that immense
responsibility. In saying this I do not touch the question,
What has caused the mischief? I speak only as to the question,
<i>Who has the power to save the country?</i></p>

<p>"1. The reality of the <i>danger</i> of disunion, I think, cannot
be doubted. The cotton States are far more unanimous
for secession than our fathers were when they made our
revolution despite of the royalist majority. Practically,
their people are unanimous. We can only hope for an
effective minority forming itself in some qualified position
within the current of popular opinion. A statesmanlike
policy would be to aid the formation of that minority&mdash;to
strengthen it that it may become a majority, to create, to
hasten, to swell the reaction for which we hope.</p>

<p>"2. Our first necessity is to comprehend the crisis. That
is difficult. A man on one side of a question cannot easily
turn out the set of ideas which fill his mind and admit the
opposite set, even for an experiment. Nothing is so difficult
in ordinary experience as to see both sides of a question.
For us who have been educated with Northern ideas or in
party controversies, we must be almost more than mortal to
be able to take a perfectly candid and impartial view of the
position of our adversaries. It is necessary to do more&mdash;to
imagine ourselves in their position, in order to form a
policy adapted to their case."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Immediately on receiving your note I
caused 50 copies of my letter to Judge Kent to be sent to
your address. I acknowledge a deep sense of the favorable
estimate you express of that effort, on a sudden occasion,
amid the toils which fell upon me as one of the Union committee,
to recall our Northern people to the duty of justice
and fraternity towards our Southern fellow-countrymen. I
have delayed writing to you to say so until I could seize a
moment in which to add a suggestion as to the future; and,
in the mean time, how rapidly, how fearfully, have events
been hurrying forward!</p>

<p>"It seems, too, that these events cast largely upon the
Virginia statesmen of this generation the momentous duty
of saving from destruction a political system which we and
the world owe mainly to the Virginia statesmen of the golden
era of the Republic."</p>

<p>"<i>Private.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Wednesday</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;I understand that you are to be
consulted this evg. as to the propriety of assuming control
of the Pres't and his adm'n from this time forward on his
promise to surrender everything to the Democrats. This
plan assumes that Church and yourself will enter heartily
into this movement, and that one of you will go into the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>"Whoever does so will, in my judgment, run a very serious
risk of damaging his own record; the adoption of the
plan will hasten rather than retard impeachment; it is not
unlikely that the finances may be deranged, which will be
chargeable to us, and with Johnson's sins of omission and
commission on our backs, we stand a fair chance of defeat,
when otherwise we might win in the coming Presidential
fight. I see nothing to be gained except a few places, very
few, too, with Congress against us, for a few men who want
position. I hope, if you agree with me, you will not countenance
the plan in any form.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO WYNDHAM ROBERTSON</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Jan. 13, '61</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I read your letter, and the printed one
you were kind enough to send me, with much pleasure, and
gave them to Mr. Miller, with the stipulation that they
should go to Messrs. Hewitt and Cooper in succession. In
the main I assent to your views.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That the late election<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was not a verdict of the
Northern States on the theoretic questions urged by the
Republicans. Masses went for Lincoln, from habit and
association, as a lineal succession from Whiggism. Masses
from mere opposition to the Democratic party, and from all
the causes which gradually operate to make a revolution between
the ins and the outs. The drift created by the disorganization
of the Democratic party, and our inability to
present any single candidate as a point of union to the conservative
sentiment, and the concession from April till October
that we must inevitably be beaten; I say this drift
alone might fairly be 24,000 out of 675,000 voters, or 3&frac12;
per cent., which would have changed the result in N. Y.
and in the Union.</p>

<p>"2. That a very important reaction has already taken
place.</p>

<p>"3. That, even if we had not had our present difficulties
to bring men to consider, Lincoln's administration must
necessarily go utterly to pieces when it came either to <i>present
affirmative measures</i> or to <i>distribute the patronage</i>.</p>

<p>"4th. That, on the whole, through all these struggles and
much apparent increase of the anti-slavery element, there
is growing a larger and stronger party, capable of doing
the Southern States full justice, than ever has existed for
half a century past; I mean, capable of recognizing, on
reason and principle, the right and the necessity the Southern
States have to grow in the natural expansion of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
industrial and social systems. In 1820 the North was
unanimous in claiming the right to attack conditions operating
after a State should be admitted. That idea is now
abandoned by a vast majority of our people. It is natural
that when a new question arises, assumed to be within our
constitutional jurisdiction, our people should all start to
apply to it the ideas on which they have acted at home. To
see that it cannot be wisely disposed of by their merely
voting in respect to it as if it were a purely domestic question;
that they must calculate for the co-existence and expansion
of the two systems; that they must partition the
Territories&mdash;is a later stage in their political education.</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that prevalent errors have, in the main,
run their course; and we need only to give our people a fair
chance to secure the adoption of a wiser and better system
than they have ever before understandingly accepted.</p>

<p>"If the present Congress continues unable to do anything
adequate, I think the next best thing will be a convention
of all the States to propose amendments to the Constitution,
with an arrangement, if practicable, to keep the parties in
<i>status quo</i> while those amendments are being perfected and
submitted. The convention should be elected in districts
on the basis of the House of Rep. The submission should be
to conventions.</p>

<p>"That would make two popular elections necessary. The
convention would be sure to be conservative. By summer
the disintegration of the Republican party would be completed,
the reaction perfected, and three-quarters of the
States would ratify amendments substantially on the basis
of Crittenden's propositions.</p>

<p>"Our people are temporarily misled, but by a vast majority
conservative at the bottom. We only need time to
bring them to a sound position.</p>

<p>"Excuse the haste with which I am compelled to write,
and believe me,</p>

<p>Dudley Burwell was a prominent lawyer in Albany, a
thoughtful and estimable man, and had been an active Democratic
partisan of Van Buren in opposition to General Cass
in 1848. He shared Mr. Tilden's apprehensions of a civil
war as the inevitable result of Mr. Lincoln's election. He
held no office himself, and I am not aware that he ever
sought any. His letter is valuable as an illustration of the
diversity of opinion among leading men of all parties by
which Mr. Lincoln's government was perplexed during the
three first years of his administration. Advice was in abundance,
but no two counsellors entirely agreed about what the
government should do or abstain from doing. It was impossible
to divine the opinions of the people upon any subject,
the succession of new and unfamiliar events was so
rapid and surprising.</p>


<h3>D. BURWELL TO CASSIDY</h3>

<p>"I pray you read this letter immediately!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">"<i>Jan'y 29th, 1861.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Cassidy</span>,&mdash;I received your telegraph this evening&mdash;and
so kind a message would have started me at once
for Albany, but one side of my face is badly swollen, and
unless it is better to-morrow I must keep within doors.</p>

<p>"From the names of the delegates to the convention, and
the disrelish now almost universally expressed against coercion,
do not doubt its expression will be strongly against
war.</p>

<p>"I hope they will make Gov'r Throop president, and that
they will name Mr. Fillmore or Gov'r Hunt, Gov'r Seymour
and Mr. Brady or O'Connor and Mr. Belmont to visit
Washington and such other places as they shall think advisable
for the purpose of persuading all belligerents to defer
all hostile demonstrations for a period of 15 months, or
until the 4th of July, 1862, in order to give the people time
to consider the whole subject and to act upon it in such way
as may be agreed upon.</p>

<p>"<i>Time is necessary. It is indispensable.</i> And if the convention
will confine itself to that one point and ask time for
consideration it cannot very decently be refused.</p>

<p>"Time is wanted&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st. That Mr. Lincoln may dispose of his patronage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"2nd. Until elections can be held in all the Northern
States, in most of which the Republicans would be defeated.</p>

<p>"3rd. That the South may try the Southern confederacy,
in which they will probably fail to realize the golden advantages,
and will be quite willing to resume their places
in the Union when they can do so with honor.</p>

<p>"I think Legislatures may be elected next fall in 2/3
of the States, a convention called, good amendments proposed
and ratified, so as to bring all the States again into the
Union, and that your convention is the proper body to <i>start
this project at this time</i>.</p>

<p>"If it takes this course it should appoint an executive
or corresponding committee to act and correspond with other
States, and should omit expressing any opinion as to the
<i>particular amendments now before Congress</i>, so as to be free
from all commitments to special and particular projects.</p>

<p>"I think this the only way of preventing war and saving
the Union.</p>

<p>"I hope the resolutions will refrain from condemning
the seceding States, also from demanding the forts to be
reclaimed, and, in fact, everything that can lead to war.</p>

<p>"I had a talk yesterday with Mr. Loomis, and he understands
my views, and will, I believe, act in accordance with
them, as they seemed to be his also.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 22.5em;">"<i>Wednesday Morning.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"The two sides of my face are too unequal to show it in
Albany, so I will add a few words which I think the most
important I have ever penned, unless there should be some
one or more who have by careful reflection come to the same
conclusion; and I hope you will not reject them on the first
perusal, but weigh them, reflect upon them, suggest them to
Richmond, Van Buren, O'Connor, etc.</p>

<p>"<i>To direct the whole action of the convention to initiate
a call of a national constitutional convention through a
requisition upon Congress by the States, and demand the
necessary and indispensable time to effect this object.</i></p>

<p>"Such action will drive the Republicans to abandon their
warlike measures, and will very likely hurry them either to
the adoption of some of the measures before Congress or
to take the initiative this winter for the call of a national
convention while they have the apparent power <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>of controlling
it.</p>

<p>"Such a movement would carry every Northern State
except Massachusetts and Vermont, would restore the Democracy
to power, and revive and invigorate the Union.
Start it, I implore you, and do not let the convention exhaust
itself on the rubbish now before Congress. We must
strike a blow at the overwhelming patronage of the Federal
government, and restore it to the States to augment their
power. We must place the South in a position where it will
feel its equality, and have the means of defending itself in
its own hands.</p>

<p>"By taking this course, simple and pure, invigorating
it with all the spirit and vehemence of the convention so as
to arrest the attention of the whole country, you will open
a door for the reunion of all Democrats at home and abroad,
and save all that is worth saving in our institutions.</p>

<p>"You recollect Act. 5&mdash;Cons. U. S.&mdash;that Congress <i>shall</i>,
on the call of 2/3 of the States, call a convention.</p>

<p>"You initiate this proceeding, then you have a reason for
demanding peace, for you have a constitutional remedy to
propose. You have an object always ahead to accomplish,
all old, obsolete issues are dead, and you have always hope to
influence the masses and the <i>Union to love</i> to incite all men
to its restoration to health and vigor.</p>

<p>"If this plan of action is proposed by others, encourage
it if you have resolved upon it; be confirmed in your resolution,
but do not, I beseech you, reject it because it comes
from so humble a source as myself. I fancy I have bestowed
as much calm reflection upon all the phases of this
state of the country as all the members of the convention.
I believe no one can be personally less interested, whether
we all go to chaos and confusion, or come out with renewed
vigor from the dangers of this dark hour.</p>

<p>"If it shall appear that I am a suggester, then I beg you
to place the matter in Van Buren's hands and let him at
the first practicable moment lay the subject fairly and
squarely before the convention. And as more think upon it
they will admit it is the thing to kill the Republican party.
If John is obdurate try Seymour and some one else.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Cassidy</span>,&mdash;I have just put a letter in the post-office
explaining why I am here instead of being in the cars
on my way to Albany, and now I acknowledge the receipt
of yours of last evening. It would have been a most agreeable
surprise to me had I seen you and Cagger on Saturday
or any other day approaching my domicile through banks
of snow. And I hope, as you have conceived the project,
you will not abandon it but come at any time.</p>

<p>"The letter I post you this morning is of grave import,
as it opens a practical work for the convention to do, and
will put you on the right road to save all that is savable of
our present Union.</p>

<p>"Do not let the Democratic sink into an Opposition party,
but present an attainable object&mdash;a work to be accomplished.
One that does not bring into discussion any of the questions
which have heretofore divided persons possessing the same
principles.</p>

<p>"The only fear I have is that, if the convention shall
prove unanimous in demanding time until a convention of
the States can be called, it will drive Weed and Seward into
the same measure, and they will endeavor, through their
present legislators, to accomplish the same object; but this
is balanced by the consideration that they must then preserve
the peace.</p>

<p>"Another fear I have is about the forts p. p. Let this
be left in the discretion of the committee you send South.
I think no harm could come from surrendering those posts
to the States where they are located&mdash;during the stay of
proceedings; of giving them, the seceding States, the benefit
of postal and other benefits on their stipulating to collect the
same revenues as are collected in other ports of the United
States, until it becomes apparent that the Union cannot be
restored.</p>

<p>"In any event, I hope and pray that no harsh, unkind,
or reproachful word will be used against the seceded States,
and that they may see that there is a real, substantial body
of men who can and do look at the matter in its true light.</p>

rest either have none at all or they are <i>very long ones</i>, and

<h3>GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT TO WM. H. SEWARD</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>March 3, 1861</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Hoping that in a day or two the new President
will have happily passed through all personal dangers
and find himself installed an honored successor of the great
Washington, with you as the chief of his Cabinet, I beg
leave to repeat in writing what I have before said to you
orally, this supplement to my printed 'views' (dated in
October last) on the highly disordered condition of our
(so late) happy and glorious Union.</p>

<p>"To meet the extraordinary exigencies of the times, it
seems to me that I am guilty of no arrogance in limiting
the President's field of selection to one of the four plans of
procedure subjoined:</p>

<p>"1. Throw off the old and assume a new designa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>tion&mdash;the
Union party. Adopt the conciliatory measures proposed
by Mr. Crittenden or the peace convention&mdash;and my life
upon it, we shall have no new case of secession, but, on the
contrary, an early return of many, if not of all, the States
which have already broken off from the Union. Without
some equally benign measure the remaining slave-holding
States will probably join the Montgomery Confederacy in
less than sixty days, when this city, being included in a
foreign country, would require a permanent garrison of at
least 35,000 troops to protect the government within it.</p>

<p>"I stop here to call your attention to the fact that Maryland
did not join the Montgomery Confederacy, and yet
with Maryland on our side to-night, it requires a garrison
of 150,000 men to protect Washington.</p>

<p>"2. Collect the duties on foreign goods outside the ports
of which this government has lost the command, or close
such ports by act of Congress and blockade them.</p>

<p>"3. Conquer the seceded States by invading armies. No
doubt this might be done in two or three years by a young
and able general&mdash;a Wolfe, a Desaix, or a Hoche, with
300,000 disciplined men, estimating a third for garrisons,
and the loss of a yet greater number by skirmishes, sieges,
battles, and Southern fevers. The destruction of life and
property on the other side would be frightful, however perfect
the moral discipline of the invaders.</p>

<p>"The conquest completed at that enormous waste of
human life to the North and Northwest, with at least
$250,000,000 added thereto, and <i>cui bono</i>? Fifteen devastated
provinces! not to be brought into harmony with their
conquerors, but to be held for generations, by heavy garrisons,
at an expense quadruple the net duties or taxes which
it would be possible to extort from them, followed by a protector
or an emperor.</p>

<p>"4. Say to the seceded States, Wayward sisters, depart
in peace!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;The heart-breaking news has just
reached us here, first of the attack and capture of Sumter,
for which the signal was so madly and wickedly given by
the administration (dominated, evidently, by the war portion
of that party) in its despatch of reinforcements; and,
secondly, of Lincoln's declaration of war by his proclamation
for 75,000 volunteers for the recapture of all the Southern
forts, that is, for the invasion of the South&mdash;an act followed,
of course, by secession of Virginia, and soon to be followed,
I have no doubt, by that of all or nearly all the border States.
Also the telegraph tells of a Massachusetts regiment resisted
in an (insane) attempt to force a passage through
Baltimore. Gracious God, that we should have lived to see
such things! You can better judge, than I could describe,
my affliction. At first it drew from me convulsions of tears.
I think it is a greater grief than that I passed through a
little short of a year ago. What doom is sufficient for
the mad authors of all this! By that I mean, for 9/10 of
the crime, the ultra portion of the Republican party. The
papers say that there is a common enthusiasm of all parties
at the North for the support of the admn. I may stand
alone, but I do not share this. I am extremely anxious to
hear from you. Do write me your views. I chafe terribly
under the impossibilities which alone prevent my hastening
home. Not only have I not the means, but I cannot leave
my debts here, when a short, prolonged stay will probably
assure me the means of paying them. Then I shall come,
to do my best in the fight at home for <i>peaceful</i> separation if
reunion has become indeed impossible. What will New
York do? I trust devoutly that if any troops march from
our State southward they may consist only of Republicans.
My hope now is that the North will at last realize the mad
horror of the whole thing, and that a cloud of witnesses will
arise to protest against its being carried further. Thus far
the country has drifted along, both sides standing obstinate
to the consistency of their opposite <i>theories</i>. But surely all
should now agree to pause and hold back! But the Republican
leaders, I fear, will now move heaven and hell to push
and drag forward the North to sustain them in the position
to which they have brought things. And I fear much from
the fighting character of our people. I dread the nex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>t news.
If Maryland goes with Virginia there will probably be
dreadful fighting for the possession of Washington, unless
the wise and patriotic like you can stop it.</p>

<p>"We are exemplifying the fable of the dispute between
the head and tail of the snake for the right to lead. The
Democratic party is the natural and the only possible government
of our Democratic confederation. It alone has
ever understood the idea of State rights. The tail has taken
its turn of leadership, and you see to what a pass it has
brought the country.</p>

<p>"Were it not for the immediate question of the fighting
to grow out of the question of the possession of Washington,
I should say it were best that the border States should
now all go at once, so as to make the North feel the absurdity
of further prosecution of war. But reunion is now, I
fear, scarcely to be hoped for!</p>

<p>"The great question for me here of the success of our
copper establishment is not yet decided. I had expected to
find the works in operation. They will not be ready to begin
short of a week or fortnight, and then there may be
further delay from changes required in details of machinery.
Everything is very encouraging. I have good prospects of
a contract for rifles and artillery from this government&mdash;it
is under consideration now. Could not do anything <i>at
present</i> in France, though the plan was recognized as superior
to their own or to anything known. But in the present
state of Europe they could not introduce a <i>change</i>, their
existing armament on their own plan being on so vast a
scale. But I was encouraged for a later day.</p>

<p>"In regard to politics, I suppose the North will be too
hot to hold <i>me</i> hereafter, if the papers are right in their
account of the Northern feeling."</p>

<h3>MR. TILDEN'S WAR RECORD</h3>

<p>His patriotic address to a regiment in 1861. Published in
New York <i>Tribune</i>, November 3, 1874:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Nov. 2, 1874</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On Saturday afternoon, June 22d, 1861, a stand
of regimental colors&mdash;the gift of its Democratic friends,
merchants and others&mdash;was presented to the 37th Regiment,
N. Y. S. Volunteers. The colors were presented at the Battery,
the regiment then being drawn up in line, and being
at the time ready to depart for the scene of war, which it
did on the following day.</p>

<p>"There was some ceremony at the presentation of the
flags, and several speeches were made. One of the speakers
on the occasion was Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, who made a stirring
appeal to the officers and men of the regiment&mdash;a speech
not excelled in patriotism by any public speaker during the
War of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>"The writer of this letter knows whereof he affirms, for
he was also present and took part in the presentation ceremony.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Lisbon</span>, <i>June 5, 1861</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;I have not yet a word from you,
and should feel more angry than I do at such a cruel silen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ce
were it not that I fear you must be sadly harassed and occupied
with your private affairs, superadded to the afflictions
of the patriot. Since my last letter I have seen in the
papers reason for some mitigation of the extreme disgust
and indignation I had before felt in regard to the conduct
of the Democratic party at the North. I had all but forsworn
it, supposing that it had all gone over, bag and baggage,
into this worst form of Republicanism, which consists
in the support of this insane and wicked war, and that, consequently,
no possible place remained for me, even in a corporal's
guard, left of it. But I see in the newspaper letter
from New York the cheering expression that 'the <i>Daily
News</i>, by taking a strong Southern view, has largely increased
its circulation, which shows that people like to see
what can be said against the war, if they do not agree with
the opinions expressed.' This assures me at least that even
though I might be myself hung for a traitor in the streets
of New York, for my sentiments on the subject, there would
still remain somebody willing to cut me down and give me
decent burial. I now look with great anxiety for the Democratic
State convention called for the 4th of July, though
what it can do to resuscitate the suicided body of the old
party I do not see. I beg you to go to the office of the <i>News</i>
and subscribe for their weekly paper for me, with the back
numbers for the period since the beginning of the war. Do
the same in regard to the <i>Day Book</i>. Let them be directed
to the U. S. Legation, Lisbon, through care of John Miller,
U. S. Despatch Agent, 26 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden,
London. Subscribe, also, for the <i>Weekly Post</i>. I must get
you to advance the payment for these subscriptions for me,
which I will repay. The <i>Herald</i> I see here through another
channel. The <i>Post</i> I want only, of course, for the object
of seeing the talk of the enemy. Do tell me all <i>your own
mind</i> on the subject. I am frankly and decidedly with the
South now in their stand of resistance against subjugation
and for independence. Whatever antecedents may have
led up to it, that stand is now rightful and honorable, and
submission would be pusillanimous and base, while in those
very antecedents four-fifths of the wrong has been on
the Northern side. This war against States constituting
nearly half of the Union is an entire violation of the whole
spirit of the Constitution, as well as of that of the law of
'95, under which it is made. It is the South which is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
fighting in defence of all the principles and rights of American
liberty, for self-government and the dignity of man,
and even though it should be conquered and subjugated the
Union of force and military centralization thence to result
would be in itself a worse political evil, and more pregnant
with future mischief, than would be <i>now</i> a confirmed separation.
However, therefore, I may deplore, with heartbroken
grief and shame, all the disasters of these fratricidal
battle-fields, yet truth and justice and conviction extort from
me the avowal that I hope the South will be successful in
beating back from their own rightfully defended soil this
most fatal and iniquitous invasion; and for this sentiment,
though it may be the extreme of treason, I am willing to
stand responsible before God and man.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my dear old fellow, whether you now go
with me the full length of my opinions, or whether I may
have to regret, as a sensible addition to all the rest of my
present affliction, that we no longer stand united in our old
accord of sentiments. <i>Eadem sentire de re publica.</i> Just
as I would have shouldered a Northern rifle to unite in the
defence of Washington against menaced invasion from the
South, so would I now, were I at home, stand up in aid of
the rightful defence of the Southern soil against this equally
unjustifiable invasion from the North; and this, were I on
that side of the Atlantic, or were it possible for me to get
there, I would do, unless I could do better service to the
cause of the right by speaking, writing, and acting for it
at the North. It is only the foolish and mad co-operation
of the deluded Democracy that has enabled the Republican
administration to undertake this war, and now enables it to
carry it on. In that sense the Democratic party is, though
secondarily, as much responsible for it as the Republicans.
If it were now to draw back and insist on peace, it has the
power to enforce that policy. This is what I would labor
for, and it is with a view to this that I have written to urge
my views upon you and upon the public, so far as you may
have consented to publish my letters, every word of which
I should be glad to see in the columns of the <i>News</i> or of the
<i>Day Book</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The wheel of public events is rolling
rapidly, and soon the good men of the country will have to
combine outside of President and Cabinet to protect the
national honor and save our institutions.</p>

<p>"Seward is premier and President, and under his weak,
mischievous rule the ship of state is rapidly approaching the
breakers. He nor the rest of the Cabinet have any administrative
ability, nor any comprehension of the immensity of
the crisis. They are all governed by a narrow policy, and
are so intent upon personal objects that the higher duties
of the citizens are made subordinate in this emergency of a
nation's life to the success of the partisan.</p>

<p>"Seward is the great failure, but he is egotistical, false,
flippant, grotesque as usual.</p>

<p>"Chase is equally vain and selfish, but more just, behind
a rampart of dogmatic egotism. Of the rest it is unnecessary
to speak, but of Blair, who is the weakest and most mischievous
of the whole set.</p>

<p>"We are in the presence of mighty events, and under the
rule of pigmies.</p>

<p>"Our foreign relations are in a critical condition, while
Seward has not the grasp to comprehend nor direct them.</p>

<p>"The maladministration of the War and Navy depts. is
in full force, while corrupt odors are continually exhaled.</p>

<p>"The army is in a disaffected, disorganized, discouraged
condition, and not in good trim for service, chiefly through
the utter incapacity of Cameron.</p>

<p>"The expenses are a million a day, which will not be
patiently borne, no matter who the people are, without corresponding
results.</p>

<p>"There is a feeling of gloomy dread in the public mind
here of coming misfortune, and let me ask you what will be
the effect upon the public opinion of the North if this city
should be taken. The enemy is in great force, daily increasing,
victorious, defiant, and in spirit and condition to be
aggressive. If he does not soon attack the capital he will
be restrained only by prudential or political considerations.</p>

<p>"The North may as well, however, look that probable event
square in the face. Thus, after a rule of five m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>onths of this
wretched Cabinet, with a great nation supporting it, with
imperial resources at command, approved and animated by
a self-sacrificing patriotism rarely equalled, we are disgraced,
dishonored before the world, and scarcely in a condition
to act bravely on the defensive. Soon France and
England may interfere, and then, pray, what is our condition?</p>

<p>"You will probably remember what I said at our first
meeting at the hotel of the strength and resources of the
South, and of the incapacity of this Cabinet to grapple with
the palpitating hearts.</p>

<p>"I am no prophet, but it seems as if we are only approaching
a mighty revolution.</p>

<p>"I am mortified and humiliated that the great, brave
American people have such representatives at the head of
their government.</p>

<p>"For what are we fighting? Congress has no voice, except
of adulation for political paramours, and this quailing,
squirming Cabinet is dumb.</p>

<p>"I have never even seen Lincoln. Mr. S. told the other
day that a Western gentleman of distinction said to him:
'Unless you soon change this Cabinet the people will change
you, and it&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The New York papers are congratulating the country
upon the loan. That is well, and I am gratified at the confidence
in the honor and resources of the nation, yet regretting
that the bankers did not make conditions, knowing that
incapacity and rascality sit enthroned at the head of the
War and Navy departments. Banks, it is said, has been
ordered to advance his lines nearer the Potomac. McClellan
is doing as well as he can&mdash;has good administrative ability.
'Tis said the lines are widening between him and Scott.
Scott is infirm, and falls asleep at a brief talk. Chase is
chiefly responsible for placing McDowell in command of the
advancing army&mdash;and thus of our defeat.</p>

McClellan approves all I have done. I am not sure as to
the President, though I think he regards my policy as the
true remedy for the special phase of the malady of secession,
which existed on the eastern shore of Virginia.
Whether he will regard it as the proper treatment for other
phases of the disease I do not know. If our madmen in

<h3>MEMORANDUM LEFT BY MR. TILDEN</h3>

<p>Mr. John Van Buren, who had become an earnest supporter
of the war, just before he made a speech at a great
Democratic meeting in the city of New York, in October,
1862, called upon Mr. Tilden.</p>

<p>"We must be for the war," said Mr. Van Buren.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mr. Tilden.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren showed a letter from General Scott, in
which he proposed to "let our erring sisters depart in peace."
Mr. Van Buren could not resist the temptation of making
an oratorical point upon the letter of the great military chieftain,
and read it to the meeting. An audience applauds
point more than reason. Mr. Van Buren was an orator who
sported with the tumultuous sympathies of a popular assembly,
as a daring horseman rides a fiery steed. In the action
and reaction between the speaker and the auditors, Mr. Van
Buren, contrary to his intention, was carried into some seeming
indulgence towards General Scott's idea. The impression
was not satisfactory to his friends or to the leaders of
the Democratic party.</p>

<p>At a casual meeting, at which were present Mr. Dean
Richmond, the chairman of the Democratic State Committee,
Mr. Seymour and Mr. Jones, the Democratic candidates
for Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Tilden was consulted.
He disapproved the aspect in which the last meeting
had left the matter, and suggested that, as Mr. Seymour
was to speak in Brooklyn on the evening of the next day, he
should at the close of his speech make a more correct and an
authoritative statement of the Democratic position in respect
to the war.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden was requested to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>duce to writing what he
suggested should be said. The next morning, on his way
down-town, he left with Mr. Seymour a sketch of a peroration
for the speech to be made that evening.</p>

<p>It was in the following words:</p>

<p>"And now, if my voice could reach the Southern people,
through the journals of our metropolis, I would say to them
that in no event can the triumph of the conservative sentiment
of New York in the election mean consent to disunion,
either now or hereafter. Its true import is restoration,
North and South, of that Constitution which had secured
every right, and under whose shelter all had been happy and
prosperous until you madly fled from its protection. It was
your act which began this calamitous civil war. It was your
act which disabled us, as we are now disabled, of shaping the

maintained your rights, will we maintain the right of the
government. We will not strike down its arm as long as
yours is lifted against it. That noblest and greatest work
of our wise ancestors is not destined to perish. We intend
to rear once more upon the old and firm foundations its
shattered columns, and to carry them higher towards the
eternal skies. If the old flag waves in the nerveless grasp
of a fanatic but feeble faction to whom you and not we
abandoned it, we, whose courage you have tried when we
stood unmoved between fanaticism and folly from the North
and South alike, will once more bear it onward and aloft
until it is again planted upon the towers of the Constitution,
invincible by domestic as by foreign enemies. Within the
Union we will give you the Constitution you profess to revere,
renewed with fresh guarantees of equal rights and equal
safety. We will give you everything that local self-government
demands; everything that a common ancestry of glory&mdash;everything
that national fraternity or Christian fellowship
requires; but to dissolve the federal bond between these
States, to dismember our country, whoever else consents, we
will not. No; never, never, never!"</p>

Judge Kent. It is full of wisdom and accurate prophecy. I
wish it could be read by all reflective men of the old Union.
Until we act upon the theories there developed, our country
must submit to the evils which error has brought upon us.
More fatal delusions never led mankind than guide the party
in power. Until they give place to reason, sound sense, and
honesty there will be no relief.</p>

<p>"In one of the addresses issued by the executive committee
here, in 1860, prepared by me, there is a predicti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>on of
the fatal consequences of elevating to power a representative
of the principles of those who nominated Lincoln. I was,
it is true, unwilling to believe what my reason told me was
inevitably true. But I felt bound to proclaim the convictions
resulting from much reflection. But our countrymen
were mad, and like mad men would heed no warning. The
fatal error was committed, the consequences of which no one
can calculate. But you, at least, are not responsible for the
result. You did all that one man could do to direct to the
path of safety. I tried to do mine, but met with no success
in making converts.</p>

<p>"I fear there is a disposition on the part of many of our
friends to take and act upon a mistaken view of our present
duty. The 'peace policy' of many will prove fallacious. I
would go with the sword in one hand and the most liberal
measures of reconciliation in the other, while I would require
all, in and out of authority, to observe the Constitution
and the rights of all citizens, and punish all infractions
where possible to do so without regard to station.</p>

<p>William Chauncey Fowler, a son of Reuben Rose Fowler,
was born September 1, 1793. When four years of age his
parents removed to Durham, Connecticut. He graduated
from Yale College in 1816, became a tutor in 1819; two
years later he became pastor of the Congregational Church
in Greenfield, Massachusetts. In 1825 he became professor
of chemistry and natural philosophy in Middlebury (Vermont)
College, whence he resigned to take the chair of
rhetoric and oratory in Amherst College in 1843. In 1825
he married the daughter of Noah Webster, and edited for
his father-in-law the university edition of Webster's Dictionary.
He served in the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1851,
and in the Senate of Connecticut in 1864. His <i>English
Grammar</i> was extensively used as a text-book in the schools.
He was a member and chairman of the school board in Durham
for twenty-five years. He died January 15, 1881.</p>

no hurt if it did no good t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>o make some further suggestions
on a topic which we discussed a little in New York&mdash;to wit.,
the expediency of my changing my residence to that city, or
of connecting myself in a business way with some gentleman
there, continuing my present official position or not till
the expiration of my term as should be thought advisable.
I have so much confidence in your good judgment, as well
as command of large business interests, that it has occurred
to me whether some sort of professional connection could
not be established between us to our mutual advantage. You
must have at times more than you can attend to, and, besides,
will find it necessary to consult your health and allow yourself
more leisure. On the other hand, my health is pretty
firm, and my disposition to labor unabated. I make the
suggestion for your consideration, and shall accept in the
best feeling any suggestions you make, whether I suppose
them to tend to my interest or not. I should be desirous if
I went to New York to connect myself with large interests,
if possible, and am persuaded no one in that respect is more
advantageously situated than yourself. And I am convinced
that with the close of this unhappy war (if it ever <i>does</i> terminate)
those interests with which your business is more
directly connected will receive a decided impulse, leading to
a large and lucrative increase of professional interests connected
with them. Besides, such connections must place
one at times in a position to make profitable investments,
and in many other respects are to be desired. If such an
arrangement could be made, I would be disposed to do what
was, on the whole, thought advisable as to the time to enter
into it. And if a business connection would not strike you
as favorable to the interests of either of us or of yourself,
I think you might make useful suggestions in regard to the
matters here hinted at, as you already have done. I pray
you to have no delicacy on the subject in saying what occurs
to you as proper. Nor let the pendency of the case before
me, in which you are counsel, have any influence to deter
you. In such matters I profess entire independence, and
while I never suspect the slightest attempt on the part of a
friend to influence me, often disappoint my best friends in
the conclusions at which I arrive. In that matter at present
I have positively no decided opinion whatsoever. May I
hear from you at your convenience, and ask you to treat
this as confidential?</p>

<p>"The sick and wounded enter the hospital department and
receive careful medical treatment until in a condition to be
forwarded to their residences. If any die at the depot, their
remains are transmitted to their friends. The system of
station agents and train couriers adopted by the board effectually
protects the returning soldiers from robbery, imposition
and vice.</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary to dwell upon the advantages of such
an institution.</p>

<p>"It secures immediate relief to the suffering and needy
men who return sick, wounded, and penniless from the war.
It removes those who possess health and money out of the
reach of the temptations of the city, and protects them from

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was obliged to leave town suddenly
on Tuesday, as my family were expecting me by a certain
train, and were in a little cottage here without any other
male protector. I do not expect to go to the city again before
Monday. I have read the city ordinance. After much
reflection, it seems to me that there are two or three modes
of raising the legal question; and I take it for granted that
the State authorities, if the draft is pressed, will act only
in support of their own judicial process. Does not the jurisdiction
of our Supreme Court, in General Term, admit of a
writ of prohibition, to be applied for on the ground that
certain persons, etc., are about to enroll, summon, and subject
to martial law A. B. and C. D., citizens of New York
and members of its militia, etc., etc.? This would avoid all
difficulty about the <i>hab. corpus</i>. If it be said that a prohibition
out of a State court cannot control a Federal officer, I
think it is sufficiently answered if the prohibition is founded
on the allegation that the Federal officer is undertaking to
act under color of a law constitutionally invalid. The
process and the case may be afterwards drawn into the
Federal judicial power for revision. But it may issue and
may be served, and then there is a legal process and not a
mere forcible resistance.</p>

<p>"The Federal court, too, has probably the same jurisdiction,
although I have not the means here of looking at that.

and Whig parties almost from the foundation of the
government. It was a faithful champion of the slave-holding
interests of the South until its representatives in Congress
withdrew from the Union. The demise of the Whig
party by the incorporation of the Northern portion of it into
the Republican party and the separation of the slave States
from the Union, left the <i>Intelligencer</i> no longer any constituency,
and after a few struggles like the one of which
we read in the following letter from Mr. Kennedy, and a
brief, precarious existence which Mr. Tilden contributed
financially to prolong its publication was discontinued.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Pond</span>,&mdash;I have been <i>credibly</i> informed to-day
that unless they shall be so fortunate as to receive immediate
relief from some friendly source, the <i>Intelligencer</i> will
actually be suspended in the course of the coming week.</p>

<p>"The paper, it is generally known, became embarrassed
by the entire loss of its large Southern circulation, consequent
on the rebellion, which loss has been followed now by
the withdrawal of the official advertisements of the govt.
departments, which they have hitherto enjoyed under almost
every administration, thus cutting off resources by which
they have managed to meet their expenditures, and rendering
imminent an event which of all others will gratify the ultra
party of the country and bring mortification on the conservatives
which they will deplore when too late to be remedied.
Its fall will exhilarate the abolitionists by the assurance it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
will appear to justify, of the opposition to extreme measures,
and the inability of the conservatives of the country to sustain
a journal at the seat of government opposed to radicalism,
and practically confirm the standing and increase the
influence of the radical press here, while it will deprive the
country of a tried and faithful watchman on the walls of
the citadel whose very presence intimidates from a surrender
of the bulwarks of the Constitution and the constitutional
union. Shall this be? Will the wealthy, patriotic, conservative
men of New York quietly permit such an advantage
to be gained by their destructive adversaries, and suffer
to be lost what holds out such a prospect and guarantee of
usefulness and necessity to them when a comparatively small
effort may avert such a catastrophe? In view of the depressing
effect which the stoppage of such a paper at this juncture
will produce on National men North and South and their
cause, and the advantages which will inure therefrom to the
sectionalists, cannot some good men of New York make up
a loan to the establishment of a few thousand dollars, which
will give it stability and independence thro' the rest of
this year, when it is to be hoped a new era will open, thereby
maintaining an important element of power for good,
in bringing about a reasonable and happy settlement of our
difficulties when the force of arms shall have accomplished
its work. Will these good people of New York allow this
old and influential journal of more than half a century's
standing to go down for defending their cause against the
destructive policy of the radicals, and when, if it go down,
the conservatives will have to make greater sacrifices in
establishing another in its stead which must be long in acquiring
the same confidence and power of usefulness? These
are questions which must be determined in a few days, or
the capital be left without a paper representing and upholding
national views and the country be deprived of a faithful
journal, which can be relied on, regardless of government
favor, and continue to do its duty to the people unawed
by power though it perish in the struggle.</p>

<p>"The amount, if supplied, may be deemed <i>and made</i> a
lien on the establishment and apply as a credit on its purchase
hereafter, or may be <i>a loan</i> to be secured by deed of
trust thereon.</p>

<p>"I have stated facts, with no personal interest to advance
other than as my w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>elfare is identified with the honor and

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Our proposed litigation here, as to the
conscription law, has thus far failed&mdash;from want of courage
on the part of the litigant, whose chance of success, within
the law, was not very encouraging, and whose doom, in the
event of failure, was very certain. The form which was
adopted by Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Wharton was that of an
injunction bill against the enrolling and drafting officers,
and the hearing hoped for was before the court <i>in banc</i>. I
now very much doubt if it will be resorted to. A <i>habeas
corpus</i> before a single judge on the receipt of notice, which
constitutes a technical custody, seems to me preferable.</p>

<p>"The draft, in the mean time, is going on and, I confess,
I am puzzled by the apathy with which it is received, especially
in connection with the admitted fact that New York
and probably New Jersey are to be exempt. Still, I think
there will be an outbreak whenever the actual kidnapping
begins.</p>

<p>"Of course you see or think you see the dangers which
threaten you more clearly than we at a distance do. But
the apprehension is very prevalent here that Gov. Seymour
is in danger at any moment of secret arrest. Things of that
kind have been hinted at, and certainly I saw nothing in
New York to make such an outrage practically difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
There is inducement enough, for his removal puts the whole
Democratic North under the heel of the radicals. My theory
about arrests is that they are always fatal. No public man
ever recovered from the stain they seem to inflict. I doubt
very much if Mr. Vallandigham will ever recuperate. Gov.
Seymour is the only public man who at this moment stands
in the way of a centralized despotism, and him a small guard
of Federal soldiers could easily and secretly remove.</p>

<p>"I am, no doubt, very nervous and very suspicious, but,
I assure you, these facts are not confined to my own bosom.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO HENRY HOGEBOOM</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New Lebanon</span>, <i>July 28th, 1863</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been peculiarly unlucky in the
attempt to answer your letter of June 18th. It came on my
return from an absence from the city, followed immediately
by another; and then by an illness which wholly disabled
me for a week, and from which I emerged only after the
commencement of the riot, and that brought upon me many
demands for attention and counsel amid ten days of excitement
and bustle. I turn to it as actually the first real business
of my own to which I have had a chance to attend for
some weeks, indeed, since the 4th of July, when I had begun
an answer, until now. I came here Saturday evening,
and expect to return to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"How swiftly events move, and how greatly they change!
I am reminded, as I see by what I began to write, how
deeply a few weeks ago I was involved in solicitude for the
results of the military operations then reaching their crisis.
At no time since this war commenced have I been so disturbed
as before the battle of Gettysburg; a different issue
of which might, in my judgment, have put us on our defence
even as far as Phila. and New York, and brought a revolution
in our thoughts and occupations, and since that New
York has been upon the verge of a social peril, at that time
wholly unexpected.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the frank and cordial spirit of your letter,
and shall state my own impressions in the same confidence
which you express that ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>r long knowledge of each other
will, at least, secure us a perfect mutual understanding. I
say impressions, for I am conscious that all my views of the
future, for myself, and for all others in whom I take interest,
may be colored by the peculiar uncertainties which
now enshroud our horizon.</p>

<p>"1. While I think it proper for you to keep your eye
upon the opportunity of forming a future business in New
York, I doubt if you can prudently abandon your present
sure and honorable position, or can count with sufficient
certainty upon events to enter at present into definite engagements
of so much importance to your interests and happiness.
I think you will remember in all our conversations
a disposition on my part (arising, perhaps, from the habitual
caution which my views of public events inspire) to contemplate
such a change in your affairs as taking effect after
the close of your present term of official service.</p>

<p>"I think, if the battle of Gettysburg had happened to be
such a disaster to us as is always possible in the vicissitudes
of war, business in New York would have been for the time,
and how long a time I know not, suspended. Who can compute
the consequences of the loss of Washington, Baltimore,
and, perhaps, Philadelphia? Nor can I be insensible to the
social disorders to which great cities are exposed during
such civil convulsions as our country is now undergoing.</p>

<p>"You are at present sure of a livelihood by a tenure and
in a geographical position which are not affected by the
military, political, or financial vicissitudes to which all business
in the city of New York is exposed, and which might
fall with peculiar severity upon a newly formed enterprise&mdash;undertaken
in reliance upon profits which any of these causes
might render illusory, and amid expenses which city life
and city business inevitably involve. Under these circumstances
I hope you will not consider it officious if I express
the opinion that it would be wiser for you, holding to your
present certainty, to await events which can scarcely fail to
shift greatly, if not frequently, before a decision can be
practically forced upon you.</p>

<p>"2. I agree with you that after the war shall have closed
the city of New York will afford scope for business corresponding
to the revivified interests of the country; but I
agree with this qualification&mdash;that it can hardly be that the
transition can be made, changing, as it will, the application
of labor and enterprise from one set of objects to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
without a shock of more or less duration, and that the retirement
by any process of the paper issues may be expected to
produce a period of constantly increasing depression. It
will be after this that, with its metropolitan character more
than ever assured, New York will return to a state of healthy
prosperity, if its position as the trade centre of all the States
be preserved.</p>

<p>"3. In respect to myself. I am not sure that the advantages
of a professional connection with me would be as great
as might naturally be expected. It has been the general
opinion of the profession that a mere counsel business, of
large extent and income, could not be permanently kept up.
So far as I have succeeded in doing this, my experience may
have been exceptional. I have years ago abandoned all ideas
of regular clientage, and could scarcely see any reason why
my business should not much diminish, perhaps almost dry
up, with the completion of that pending at the time. The
substitution of mere business&mdash;easy to be deputed, regular
in its flow, and almost formal in its nature, which is the
basis of large profits in the general experience of the bar&mdash;I
have not had, possibly because I had not the organization
in my office to do it, and could not do it myself without abandoning
the part to which I have devoted myself. If ten
years ago I had provided for it what it might have grown to
is a matter of conjecture. It is now too late for me to undertake
the labor, care or responsibility, or even to acquire
the disposition to construct such a business. How far, in
lessening my active connection with affairs of the peculiar
nature mine has become, I could transfer would be doubtful.
Indeed, it would seem to me that some species which
have occupied half of my attention for five years past are
likely to disappear.</p>

<p>"4. Some years ago I had two suggestions of what seemed
to be very flattering connections. One of them was of several
intimate friends, who thought we could combine and build
up a larger concern than ever existed in this city. I assented
to that opinion, but shrank from assuming obligations and
necessities which could not be practically terminable at my
own choice. Uncertain how long health would permit or
necessity require the efforts I was then making, or how long
a disposition to continue them would survive the immediate
occasion for them, I felt that I should unavoidably part with
the perfect freedom of my choice if I allowed friends to
build their calculations upon me&mdash;that no reservation I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
could make would exempt me from a sense that what I might
prefer to do would disappoint or damage those with whom I
had entered into the joint undertaking.</p>

<p>"In the interval these motives for keeping free from all
connections have strengthened, while all motives to form
them have nearly ceased. The necessities of that day have
been fulfilled. My health requires an exemption for a time
of more or less duration, from the cares which would attend
any new engagements, or, indeed, the thought whether or
not business is to continue. Everything that I could endeavor
to foresee, whether personal, as health, taste, my remaining
here or travelling to Europe or to the far West,
or whether public, as financial or political events amid the
civil commotions of our country&mdash;everything, in a word,
which could ordinarily form the subject of calculation, seems
to be more uncertain than ever before. My habit, therefore,
in all things&mdash;I scarcely know whether it comes of disposition
or of judgment&mdash;is to make no plans at present, except
such as are inevitable; to await events, and to keep myself
as prepared as possible to act, free from engagements and
even from predeterminations of my own mind, according to
the changing phases of affairs.</p>

<p>"I have thus, my dear sir, unveiled to you more of my
private affairs and thoughts than, perhaps, are known to
any other person; for I have written them as if we were
talking together, writing my ideas as they arose, without
much method or care.</p>

<p>"Please consider them as confidential, and excuse the
haste with which they are expressed and the length to which
my letter has grown. Accept the frankness of my revelations
and suggestions as an evidence of my cordial interest
in your views, and be assured that whatever I can do by
way of information, advice, or suggestion towards your purpose,
if you continue to entertain it, will be at all times at
your service.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been doing all that one overburdened
man can do to adjust matters with the general
government. I am satisfied it means to go on in a spirit of
hostility to this State; that it is governed by a spirit of malice
in all things small and great. I do not believe they will
accept volunteers on account of the draft. Let it be so. I
am willing to accept results. This conscription will make
the administration odious and contemptible. It will fail
as a measure to raise men. I do not take into account forcible
resistance which will aid rather than embarrass government.
It will break down because it is impossible to coerce
a people. Some will commute, some will run away; many
will prove disabilities, and a few will go, enough, perhaps,
to demoralize the army. I have sent a communication to the
President, written in calm and respectful terms, objecting:</p>

<p>"1. To the fairness of the movement.</p>

<p>"2. To the policy of conscription.</p>

<p>"3. Asking for a test of the constitutionality of the
measure.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;An absence from the city and the occupations
preparatory to it have deferred my acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of your letter longer than I intended.</p>

<p>"In respect to the first topic of your letter, although we
both agree in considering it practically past, the desire I have
that the real state of facts should be completely understood
by you induces me to add a word to our former discussions.</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can now recollect, the misunderstanding
occurred about the time, I think even before, my action in
respect to the Peninsula was decided. The false relation
between Mr. Ogden and you with the impressions which
such of our friends as occasionally met Mr. Parsons derived
from him repelled overtures to you. Mr. O. always said
that he thought he could satisfy you, but doubted and deferred.</p>

<p>"There never was a moment when I did not desire to
communicate with you; but my acquaintance was so slight
that I thought it necessary to wait for others, until at last
I forced a breaking of the ice, and our interview took place.</p>

<p>"But enough of this. I should not recur to the topic if
I had not a great respect for you. The past is gone. We
can deal only with the present. That is within our powers.
I do not think that, on the whole, we cannot now do nearly
as well as if we had done what was best at first. For myself,
I have so often felt your reproach for having omitted
to promote our understanding, so capable of benefits to both
sides, that I am determined as to the present and the future,
which alone are in our power&mdash;that the boot shall be on the
other leg.</p>

<p>"Coming now to what is the really important part of your
letter&mdash;put after the fashion of the ladies in the P. S.&mdash;it
must be admitted that if you should meditate anything
more than a mere <i>sale</i> on the best security&mdash;anything approaching
in part to a sharing of the common joys and
sorrows of the adventure&mdash;the future policy of Peninsular
company, in the particulars mentioned by you, would be an
important matter.</p>

<p>"I think that policy will be, whether in your society or
out of it, <i>conservative</i> to your heart's content.</p>

<p>"It would, no doubt, be very desirable to have the terminus
of the Peninsular at Escanaba or Sand Point connected
with Green Bay by rail. What we can do on that
point, and what we cannot, has been definitely announ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ced
to Mr. Ogden and others by me assuming to speak for the
very solid gentlemen who are the principal owners of the
Peninsular.</p>

<p>"If the Northwestern will build that road we shall be
glad. We do not believe the difficulty of operating it in
the winter is any more real than it was supposed to be from
Boston to Albany or from Piermont to Dunkirk twenty years
ago; or as much so as on the Chicago and St. Louis in 1856.
There will be a telegraph to Marquette in a few months. An
all-rail line to that point would revolutionize the region.</p>

<p>"If the N. W. needs the privileges of our charter or the
land grant which attaches to the portion of the line from
Escanaba to the Menominee, we ought to accord them so
that we incur no pecuniary liability for the construction or
operation of the line.</p>

<p>"If the N. W. needs that we consent to a modification of
the drawback which it is to allow us on its whole 242 miles
for joint business that comes to or from the Peninsula&mdash;we
may do that.</p>

<p>"But we cannot dilute our present investment by what
will be inferior, though incidentally very desirable to us;
or enlarge our undertaking from what we know to be completely
within our means, of which we have measured the
cost, and except to a very subordinate extent fixed it by
purchases and contracts. If any of us aid the line south
by taking an interest in it, it will be as a separate adventure.</p>

<p>"Not only has this been our uniform answer to such suggestions,
but our present mortgage expressly excludes any
extensions south from its provisions in favor of extensions
north.</p>

<p>"Now as to extensions north, our policy would be not less
provident. We must feel our way, accepting only what will
surely be remunerative and not diluting our investment.</p>

<p>"So much in answer to your letter.</p>

<p>"Now a few words in addition on the general subject.</p>

<p>"1. Separately, our charges can scarcely fail to be affected
25 cents by the mutual fear of competition, alleviated
as much as possible. That all comes from the profits on
300,000 tons; it is the interest on a million.</p>

<p>"2. In a state of paper-money prices, advancing constantly
because of increasing issues, we can protect ourselves
only by making rates correspond with daily increasing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>expenses.</p>

<p>"This is not apt to be done with sufficient promptitude
and boldness.</p>

<p>"You will be and we shall be timid and laggard in meeting
the exigencies which are before us&mdash;from fear of competition
and from the delay which always attends arrangements
between independent parties.</p>

<p>"3. We should better our condition as to our land grants
if our efforts were joined. We could do so at the present
session of Congress.</p>

<p>"There are other considerations which I have not time
to discuss.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to arrive at results as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"1. Some important construction we have deferred to
await the negotiations.</p>

<p>"2. We shall soon have to decide important questions
which would be affected very materially by the junction of
our interests. Of course, we are not so improvident as to
act now on the hypothesis of successful negotiations between
us.</p>

<p>"Our construction is advancing well. We have sent up
400 additional men since Feb. 1. We still strain every
nerve for completion June 1. None of our managers in the
West fear that it will be much later. I assure you that in
this respect and in all respects our affairs were never so
promising as now. I express my strong desire to form a
junction of our interests as frankly as if you did not represent
the other party to the negotiation; for, while attending
carefully to everything necessary to our independent existence,
I see that it can still be bettered by the measure contemplated.
There is no mistake so common among business
men as to suppose that what one gains another loses. I
have just had an illustration of this in making in behalf of
the bondholders of the Fort Wayne a counter proposition to
that of the stockholders under which the stock rose 40 per
cent.</p>

<p>"It is important to all interests that a conclusion be arrived
at as soon as possible. When you are in a situation
to negotiate definitely, with full powers, I shall be glad to
discuss and also to submit suggestions, and shall be ready
to conclude arrangements, if any be found practicable.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO JOS. S. FAY</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>April 8th, 1864</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 4th was duly received.</p>

<p>"In reference to your conclusion that there is 'no difficulty
in arranging some mode of sale but <i>price</i>,' I agree
that it is justified by the general correspondence of our views
as to the utility of uniting the two lines and as to the policy
which should govern the management of the joint concern.
Doubtless your mind has truly fixed the precise point at
which divergence of sentiments would be natural, and where
alone it is likely to exist.</p>

<p>"But is such divergence inevitable even there? Is there
not some solution which will give us what we agree in
desiring&mdash;the unity of works and interests, and will yet
allow scope enough for the favorable view by each party of
the relative value of its own property?</p>

<p>"Financial expedients are so capable of adaptation, and
I have so often been fortunate in bringing into accord interests
and opinions which seemed to the parties to clash,
that, seeing an object desirable to us both obstructed or
delayed, I am disposed at once to analyze the elements of
difference, and try if there be not some solution equally
advantageous and equally agreeable to the parties whom we
respectively represent.</p>

<p>"I know I shall bring to the attempt candor in considering
what I may not at first accept, and an entire freedom
from the huckstering spirit which seeks to appropriate all
benefits of a concord which ought to be founded upon mutual
interests. I do not doubt that you will meet me in the same
dispositions.</p>

<p>"I mentioned in my former letter some of the evils of
delay&mdash;the loss of the present session of Congress in respect
to our land grants (we should want Mr. Morgan as our
regular attorney to join his efforts to our special and temporary
agent if we were together), the tendency to reduce or
keep down the prices for our transportation services, from
the natural operation of divided action, to be aggravated
perhaps when our agents c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>ome to seek business, the probability
of some unnecessary construction.</p>

<p>"You have justly added the inconvenience of extending
over the region a diversity of gauges, every day becoming
more difficult to change.</p>

<p>"And I now add still another consideration. The delay&mdash;perhaps
indefinite postponement of the construction of
the link from Green Bay to the place, lately Sand Point,
which we have christened Escanaba. That construction
would connect the mineral regions of Lake Superior with
the entire railroad system of the country.</p>

<p>"Now, in these times so favorable to get money for new
enterprises, if the opportunity is <i>seized</i> and <i>wisely used</i>, I
think if we were united, our joint strength would induce
the Northwestern to put in that link this year if the question
could be determined within the next 30 days. There
are auxiliary influences, potent at this moment, which may
be lost and the result postponed for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>"I am confident that such a construction would enlist the
warmest sympathies of yourself, of Mr. Ely, and of all who
have investments in the Lake Superior region. It would
probably create, likewise, new opportunities for investments,
capable of surviving the financial shock to which all property
will be subjected by the present condition of the country.</p>

<p>"But I wander into discussions, when the object with
which I began my hasty letter was simply to say to you that
I think we ought to have a personal conference without unnecessary
delay&mdash;that we ought to be possessed of the purposes
of our respective parties, and armed with full powers
to act, if not for all, at least for a majority in interest of our
respective companies.</p>

<p>"I will meet you in Boston or in this city at your earliest
convenience, having a little notice to arrange my engagements.
My situation would make me prefer New York, if
your convenience would allow or you could be induced into
a visit to your friends here.</p>

to complete, in your city, his preparation for practice in the
law. I have taken the liberty of advising my son to call
upon you for the reason that I believe a few words of
friendly advice from yourself would be of great value to
him in fixing upon his selection of an office for further

counsel for the corporation of the city and county of New

Cleveland's Cabinet as Secretary of the Navy during that
President's first term. He died in 1904.</p>


<h3>TILDEN TO S. C. BALDWIN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Nov. 17, 1864</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There are so many topics about which
I desire to write you that I must touch them rapidly.</p>

<p>"1. You and Wetmore are elected directors of the Iron
Cliff. You will be entitled to the information, advice, and
aid which Wetmore shall be able to give.</p>

<p>"You must represent the company and act in all cases
where it is necessary.</p>

<p>"2. <i>Information.</i> We need direct and frequent communications
with the Cliff Co.</p>

<p>"Mr. Curtis will have more time than the rest, and his
occupations will be more regular. He should write <i>twice
a week</i>, giving information as to all matters concerning the
operations of the co., the no. of men, the preparations to accommodate
them, the work going on, etc.</p>

<p>"From you I should like to hear as often as you are able.</p>

<p>"Communications should be addressed S. J. Tilden, 12
Wall St., New York City.</p>

<p>"3. Col. Foster left Mr. Ray in charge of the Tilden and
Foster mines; Mr. Foote in charge of the Ogden; Mr. Curtis
managing the accounts and finances, and Mr. Whitehead
conducting explorations; and these gentlemen, all in the
main, independent of each other.</p>

<p>"I shall be surprised if disorganization does not develop
the want of a <i>head</i> to enforce accountability and to govern
and direct.</p>

<p>"For the time being you must assume and exercise whatev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>er
powers seem to be necessary in order to keep harmony
between all these different authorities, and to see that all are
working well.</p>

<p>"&#9758; Whether we shall need a <i>mining</i> head, independently
of these gentlemen, is a question upon which, after
you have studied them, and the working of the business, I
should like your opinion. It may be that a general business
head will be all that will be required, and that Mr. Ray and
Mr. Foote will get along well in their respective departments.
Or it may be that some man like Mr. Merry or Mr. Ferguson
will be required.</p>

<p>"Between us, Mr. Merry told me, just before I left, that
he wished me to bear in mind that he expected to be with
us next year. Mr. Stewart, of the Jackson Co., rather complained
to Col. Foster that Mr. Ogden had interfered with
them in respect to Merry.</p>

<p>"I mention the state of things that you may be advised
of the actual state of the case, and may be considering what
information and advice you can give me.</p>

<p>"As to Mr. Curtis&mdash;he was engaged by Col. Foster as a
sort of cashier when the former was about leaving without
our having much knowledge or experience in respect to him.
I have been to see Mr. Booth, who recommended him, and
get the best accounts as to his trustworthiness.</p>

<p>"Whether we can hereafter enlarge his functions will
depend upon how his capacities shall develop in the experience
of our business.</p>

<p>"In the mean time he should be required to <i>organize</i> our
<i>accounts</i>, take an inventory of all materials and supplies
sent up for the use of the company, keep a record of their
use, and be able to account for them; open an account with
each mine, and enable us to know that all the expenditures
of each are proper, keeping a sort of financial supervision
over their operations; corresponding with us, and keeping
us advised of everything which is going on.</p>

<p>"Col. Foster informs me that he instructed Ray and Foote
to send here a report each week of their doings.</p>

<p>"&#9758; Consult with Mr. Wetmore and give me your
views as to</p>

<p>"(1) What is necessary for the sale of ore and the management
of transportation at Cleveland or elsewhere; study
the organization of the other companies; see whether it is
best, etc.</p>

<p>"(2) What will be necessary at Escanaba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"(3) Whether anything further will be necessary at the
mines.</p>

<p>"5. It will be quite necessary for us to have the branch
to the Cliff mines and the extension to the Cleveland done,
and all the road in good running order.</p>

<p>"6. It is very desirable that we have this winter the benefit
of a telegraphic communication with the Cliff mines.</p>

<p>"It is equally necessary for the Peninsular railroad. And
for that&mdash;but <i>especially for the Northwestern</i>&mdash;a winter
road from Escanaba to Green Bay is important.</p>

<p>"7. For the Iron Cliff mines see that all necessary supplies
are provided; see Ray and Foote on this subject, and
have them closely interrogated that nothing may be overlooked;
Mr. Merry would aid with all his experience in
making provisions for winter work, and Mr. Wetmore will
also have much information on this subject.</p>

<p>"8. In respect to any question requiring experience in
working mines, Mr. Merry was good enough to say he would
aid Mr. Ray (who is his brother-in-law) and us generally.
You can have recourse to him, if necessary.</p>

<p>"9. It is thought that at the Ogden mine (Foote) accommodations
ought to be made for at least 50 men; and at the
Tilden mine for 100 men.</p>

<p>"This is for immediate operations, looking, of course, to
enlargement as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"10. I intended to write to you on the subject of furnaces,
but must defer that subject to a future occasion.</p>

<p>"&#9758; Please advise me of the condition of the Peninsular
R. R., and give me what information you can as to the
mines, dock, branches, etc.</p>

<p>"One of the most serious inconveniences attending the
construction of the Peninsular&mdash;all through&mdash;has been the
want of regular information here.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO CHARLES P. DALY, CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON

<p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;Your letter, inviting me to 'address the
great meeting, to be held at Union Square to-morrow, to
celebrate the recent national victories,' reaches me while I
am confined by illness, and expect to be, at the time of the
meeting, totally disabled from speaking. I shall, however,
none the less, join in rendering the most grateful homage
to the achievements of our gallant soldiers and sailors and
their skilful commanders, and the most cordial appreciation
of the value of these achievements towards preserving the
unity of our Federal Republic, and the nationality of the
great people which has been formed under the shelter of its
rightful and beneficent sway.</p>

<p>"These sentiments have never been weakened, even when
it has sometimes seemed to me that this great object of our
efforts and sacrifices was imperilled, and those efforts and
sacrifices made more costly, if not fruitless, by errors of
civil policy or of military or financial administration. Nor,
amid such errors, and all errors tolerated during the
'throes and convulsions' of civil war, by the people, who
were in so unaccustomed a situation, and were intensely
occupied by the great struggle in which they were involved,
have I ever lost faith that, when the struggle should
be once successfully over, they would completely re-establish
the great traditions of constitutional government, founded
on local self-control and on individual liberty and personal
rights.</p>

<p>"Let me add that, in the present posture of our public
affairs, it is better to look forward than to look behind&mdash;to
think of battles to be fought rather than of victories already
won, and in preparing that wise and liberal statesmanship
by which alone a complete pacification of the country is to
be attained, to remember that '<i>peace hath its victories, not
less renowned than war</i>.'</p>

<p>"To co-operate, candidly and cordially, with the existing
public agents in all measures for bringing the war to a successful
close, and to remove the evils it will have engendered
in our civil and social systems seems to me as plain a duty
as it is at every election to promote the choice of such public
agents as will, in our judgment, best attain these ends.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wash.</span>, <i>19 Oct., 1865</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;I have a letter from Frank, written
at Cincinnati previously to his speech in St. Louis, in which
he refers to you and myself to judge of <i>the circumstances</i>,
the <i>when</i> and the <i>how</i>, he shall do what it seems he has
declared to the country publicly he is ready to do, if necessary,
to advance the cause of the party which nominated him
to the Vice-Presidency. If, therefore, any change is to be
made in the persons to represent our cause in the Novr. elections,
please telegraph and I will come instantly to meet you.</p>

<p>"So much as concerns Frank's position.</p>

<p>"Now let me say a word about the intrigue which produces
our difficulties.</p>

<p>"Seward and Chase, who never were identified with the
Democracy, have entered into a coalition to control its destiny.
They were 'unco-thick and thrang thegither' last
winter, and Seward disclosed to an ardent Democrat the
other night the cause for which they combined. Seward
approached a brother-in-law of Voorhees and made an eloquent
appeal to him to convince a company brought together
for the purpose that it was necessary that Chase should supplant
Seymour, and, of course, that the nominations of our
convention should be surrendered. Now it is clear that the
Chief Justice and the Secretary of State have undertaken to
dispose of our party. Neither ever had its endorsement for
any station. Why should they be allowed to dispose of the
highest without having consulted the people?</p>

<p>"If we are to change <i>front</i>, why not take McClellan and
Pendleton, who have been endorsed by national convention
and the party at the polls? Why not Hancock and Hendricks,
who had high votes in our late convention? Why not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
McClellan and Hendricks? Or Hancock and Adams? We
might bring Indiana and Penna., or Indiana and Ohio by
their most famous Democratic sons to increase the vote of
the last election in these States. I think these or many other
combinations might be made to strengthen our ticket.</p>

<p>"In my opinion the copulation of Seward and Chase
would bring not only defeat, but eternal disgrace on the
Democracy.</p>

<p>"This, however, all for yourself. What I have to say
further about the second to Mr. Seymour will be in person
and in consonance with your joint wishes.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 15th inst., enclosing
me the very handsome testimonial of the citizens of New
York, with names of all the too generous contributors to it,
is received. I feel at a loss to know how to express my appreciation
of this substantial token of the friendship of the

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am, in one sense, not a politician, and my
opinion is not worth so much as those of others; but in the
sense of being always interested in public affairs, I am perhaps
a politician. What I mean is, that I have not a view
of things from inside of the machinery.</p>

<p>"From the outside I have naturally thought about candidates
for Governor. I have come to the conclusion that you
are the best man for the place. I take it for granted you
have no desire for the place, for I am willing to judge you
as favorably as I would judge myself, and such a place
would have no temptations for me.</p>

<p>"But at this time you have no right to consider only
your own convenience.</p>

<p>"You are the best man&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Because you would poll more votes than any other
(Dix included); you are above the rings and cliques, and
would excite no personal antagonisms.</p>

<p>"2. Because you could, after election, make a party of
the right materials. The only set of men who can bring
back our politics to purity and statesmanship are the Barnburners
of this State; after carrying the election these men,
whether they have voted of late years the Democratic or
Republican ticket, could, under you, be brought together&mdash;could
make a new Democratic party, slough off the corrupt
elements, especially that malign influence with which we
shall have to act this election, T. W., and dictate a reform
in the Cabinet which should give the influence of the general
government to the same sound principles as of old controlled
this State. This, I think, is the <i>great</i> movement to be made
in politics&mdash;the reconstruction into compact force of the
divided Barnburners, and for this we must carry this State
election first, no matter what allies we have to take in for
the present.</p>

<p>"I, of course, shall not mention your name for the place
to any one, but, if it should be offered you, you must not

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There is a rumor here that some changes
in the Federal appointments for this city are being projected.
My object in writing you this morning, in too much haste
to allow of any discussion, is to say that <i>before anything of
this character is done</i> those who represent the mass of President
Johnson's supporters in this State, in an authentic and
authoritative form, wish an opportunity of submitting their
views to him.</p>

<p>"It is important, in the last degree, that in any changes
which are made in the great appointments here, and, indeed,
in any of them, the influence which these offices are capable
of exercising should be held and exerted as a sacred trust
for the success of the administration and the policy of President
Johnson.</p>

<p>"To give them away as mere personal benefactions&mdash;to
allow them to become the mere aids to ambition or interest
of a selfish individual or clique, to be disposed of by him
or it as mere patronage or for pecuniary gain&mdash;would be
suicide on the part of the President and a betrayal of his
supporters and his cause.</p>

<p>"In the course of a week or ten days I shall have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
pleasure to see you and to discuss these matters.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, please do me the favor to communicate
to the President the request contained in this note, and
let it remain strictly confidential between you and him.</p>

<p>"You will notice that the <i>Times</i> of this morning staggers
a little. The real difficulty is that it <i>is losing subscribers</i>.</p>

<p>"Up to the time of Mr. Richmond's death the arrangement
for the State nominations was that the Democrats
should take the Governor and the Republicans the Lieut.
Governor. The only chance that Dix had was in a movement
which was originated by me. It was contingent on
events which could not be controlled, and on the failure of
which it was only to be persisted in under circumstances
which could not be prudently defied. But enough till I see
you. Let us be firm and courageous and go forward.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I went from Albany to Chautauqua Co.,
and did not get your telegram until late Saturday night&mdash;not
in time to answer. It is impossible for me to go to New
York. I am obliged to go to Albany to-night on business, and
then hurry back to the Lockport circuit. On many accounts
I would be glad to go to New York, but there will be many
better speakers there than I am.</p>

<p>"I hope the committee will make you chn., and I have
said so to everybody I have seen. I regard it very important
that it should be so, although some of our friends think it
should not be in N. Y.; but these men don't know that you
belong to the party in the State, and not in the city.</p>

<p>"Now for the campaign. To be successful it must be
effective; not merely noisy, but a hard-working campaign,
and you will excuse a few practical suggestions.</p>

<p>"1st. A large amount of money must be raised, which, if
properly laid out, will help very much. I think every county
should have $1000, in two instalments&mdash;$500 to take a thorough
canvass; this can only be done by hiring men in each
town to do it. We have not had a canvass worth anything in
many years, and an incorrect canvass is worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> than none.
The only way to do it is to appoint a reliable man in each
judicial district to visit each co. and put the money and canvass
books in the hands of a reliable man, who will <i>hire and
pay the men</i> to take the canvass. It can be done in no other
way.</p>

<p>"Then, during the week before the election, $500 more
to be paid in getting the votes to the polls.</p>

<p>"2. A thorough and systematic course of meetings in
every co.</p>

<p>"Such a campaign, carried on by the State com., with
what our friends will do in each co., will carry the State.
Anything short of this will result in defeat, in my judgment.</p>

<p>"The utmost care must be exercised to have the money
properly expended. In most of the counties in the State we
have no local officer to help us, and no canvass can be obtained
except in the way I indicate&mdash;by paying men by the
day for doing it.</p>

<p>"Confidentially. Cannot the pressure be made for the
Collectorship before election? I suggest it only for your
consideration. I shall be happy to hear from you.</p>

<p>"We are in receipt of communications from reliable
friends from many sections of New York expressing the
opinion that removals made so soon before the election are,
as a general thing, inexpedient, and may do injury to the
cause. The President feels, therefore, that, in making
changes, the greatest care should be exercised. He desires
to meet the wishes of his friends, but he desires, also, that
his friends should be fully and thoroughly advised before
they endorse applications for changes.</p>

<p>"It has occurred to me that a change of Collector in the
St. Lawrence district at the present time would be injudicious;
and while we desire to take care of Gen. Barney, we
are of the opinion that it would not be advisable to appoint
him Collector just now, certain as it is that his nomination
will be rejected by the Senate.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your two favors of the 22nd inst. are received.</p>

<p>"Campbell's appointment was suspended because we were
advised that the incumbent was ill and a conservative; that,
while absent for the benefit of his health, the office is being
administered by the deputy, who is a hearty supporter of the
President. Under the circumstances of the case it was
thought best by some of our judicious friends that no change
should take place in the office; at all events, until after the
election.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>"The decision of the President to withhold from Mr.
Campbell his commission was not influenced by the representation
of any gentlemen unfriendly to Mr. Campbell or his
brother, the candidate for Congress, but rather from a desire
to do nothing which might impair the administration's
strength in the district. After the election the subject will
receive due consideration.</p>

<p>"In regard to the 12th district, I have only to say that a
good deal of disapprobation has been expressed by the appointment
of Mackin as assessor; and as there seemed to be
a good deal of difference of opinion among our friends in
the district in regard to the removal of the collector, it was
thought advisable to make no change in that office for the
present.</p>

<p>"It is pretty clear to my mind that in order that an office
should be made effective in an election, it is important that
the office should be fully and properly organized some time
in advance.</p>

<p>"The President desires to make as few changes as possible,
and none on political grounds unless it is clear that the
interests of the service or the interests of the administration
are to be certainly benefited by them. I will, however, present
this case again to the President.</p>

<h3>JOHN A. DIX TO TILDEN<br />

ANTI-RENTERS AND THEIR LEASES</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>19 June, 1867</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I wrote you some two months ago, but
have not heard whether you received my letter. I expressed
the hope that you would be a member of the constitutional
convention, and was very glad to see that you were chosen.</p>

<p>"I presume the anti-renters will endeavor to get some
amendment of the Constitution, by which they may become
owners of the fee of the lands they hold under leases without
compensation. This, if done directly, would impair the
obligation of contracts, and would be declared void by the
Supreme Court of the U. S. It will, therefore, probably be
attempted indirectly&mdash;by burdening leased lands with disabilities
and exactions, which will make them of little or no
value to landlords.</p>

<p>"In regard to leases forever, it is possible that there may
be a proposition to convert them into allodial tenures by
giving to lessees the right to redeem them by paying to the
lessors a principal sum, which will yield the rent in the
annual interest. This would be to introduce a condition not
in the contract. I would not object to it on any other ground
if the sum paid were sufficient to yield the rent at an interest
of four per cent., which is considered a fair rate on agricultural
lands. For instance, if the annual rent on a farm or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
lot leased forever were $70, the principal sum to be paid
should be $1750. If only $1000 were paid&mdash;a principal
sum, which at legal rate (7 pr. ct.) interest yields the rent&mdash;the
landlord would be put to the trouble of reinvesting on
less durable and safe security.</p>

<p>"In regard to leases for years or for lives, the convention
should not interfere. It may, if it choose, declare that hereafter
no leases for lives shall be given. The Constitution
has already declared that there shall be no leases of agricultural
lands for more than twelve years; and this is a bad
restriction for tenants. But leases for lives are in the process
of rapid extinction, and they are not renewed now. My
father-in-law, Mr. Morgan, gave a large number of such
leases sixty years ago. Some of them are still in existence,
although they were only for three lives, which in England
are considered equivalent to 21 years. We are selling on
liberal terms to the lessees or their representatives. There
should be no interference with such tenures, unless it be to
prohibit them in future. Every man on Mr. Morgan's land
who has used it in a farmer-like manner has grown rich.
Only the idle or improvident, and now and then an unlucky
fellow, have failed to make money. The lands were leased
for the interest of less than $3 per acre. They have for
thirty or forty years been worth treble and quadruple that
price, and the tenants have reaped all the benefit of the advance.
Now to interfere in any way with the reversionary
interest of the lessor would be the grossest injustice to him.
Of course it would be a violation of the contract, which we
should resist; and it would do an incalculable injury to a
commercial State like New York, whose vitality depends so
much on the inviolability of its faith and the security of
property of all kinds.</p>

<p>"Should there be any movement of the kind I have adverted
to, I wish you would talk with Evarts, Pierrepont,
and others of the right-thinking men of the convention; and
if you please, show them this letter.</p>

<p>"I am very hard pressed between the exposition, the foreign
sovereigns, and our own home sovereigns, of whom we
have a tremendous influx, and write you '<i>currente calamo</i>,'
as you see.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;Your long absence gives anxiety to your
friends here. We miss you in council and on the floor. You
must come up soon; for we will have to meet the financial
question, and want you. I would have written you before,
but have been laid up by the heels myself for a fortnight.
Indeed, I would have gone down to New York to see you if
I had been able. I would have asked leave of absence, but
each day you were expected to be on hand, and I am opposed
to placing on record the fact that you were ever ill. A
majority of the convention has been on the sick list. Take
160 middle-aged men, and you will have a pretty large show
of invalids in midsummer, when all classes are accustomed
to vacation.</p>

<p>"You have lost nothing thus far. We have lost your
speech on naturalization, etc. It must come in elsewhere.
Write me, and tell me what I can do to aid you, and when
you expect to be on board.</p>

I would call your attention to the subject of a paper in

harm the writer. Such things are usually found in letters
asking favors. I do not know what can be done in such cases.
I know that you as well as I have to meet such calls every
day of the week. I hurried up my letter, getting my name
off of the list of candidates so that I might save what little

<h3>HORATIO SEYMOUR TO TILDEN<br />

A POLITICAL FORECAST</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Utica</span>, <i>Dec. 13, 1867</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;This is a bitter cold morning, and I
have made up my mind to keep by the bright wood fire which
is blazing on the hearthstone in my farm-house. I shall
make use of the time to write to you a political letter. It is
seven years since the Democratic party went out of power.
Seven years of war or of discord, of corruption, of hate, of
taxation and tyranny. In that time, how many who have
enjoyed the honors and profit given to them by the Democratic
party have turned against it and have proved to be
its bitterest foes! How few were left to stand up against the
storms of insult, scorn, and threats which beat upon any man
who cared for principles of liberty, humanity, and rights!
But there were those who did this, and they live to see the
day dawning when right and truth will conquer.</p>

<p>"But all conditions have their dangers. The time-servers
and spoil-hunters are seeking to come back to our party, not
as penitents, but as leaders. They may in time forgive us
for not joining in their treachery, but it will always be
counted against us that we did not go out with them to gather
spoils. There is danger that these men may divide those
who stood together in the years of trial and of trouble. They
hatch schemes to draw off some who have strength, and thus
break up the band that held together in the dark days.</p>

<p>"What should we do to counteract these plans? We have
in New York a great party. It is fresh, vigorous, and united.
It is animated by a sense of past wrongs and of future victories.
We have but a few leaders, for none but men of
nerve and of truth could stand the tests of the last seven
years. Those leading men are well placed in different part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>s
of the State, so that neither their numbers nor positions
make them clash. All fair and honorable ambitions can be
gratified&mdash;could we be more fortunately organized. Let us
in a generous spirit train up as many new men as we can
and fit them for places of honor and trust, but do not suffer
those who come in sunshine and leave us in storms to walk
into our councils and shape our policy with a view to their
own gain. We who have held to the cause of constitutional
liberty have not always agreed in our views. At times there
may have been irritation. But surely past trials have made
a groundwork of an attachment and confidence which cannot
be felt towards those who turned against us or who shrank
away in our times of trouble. Those generals without troops
who want to come back into leadership will bring no strength,
but much discord. To my mind it is clear that policy and
duty alike demand that we should stand, as to organization
and counsellors, where we are. We do not want more leaders.
We have the public with us. But something must be done
to let all of our friends feel that we are to act together in
the spirit that should be, and I think has been, nurtured in
trials we have passed through. We must have the whole
matter frankly talked over. In the mean while each one
should keep clear of all entanglements. I have written to
Sandford E. Church on this subject in the way I write to
you. I wish you would let me know your views. I think
eight or ten men should meet at Albany as soon as the
Legislature gets under way. You should see four or five
in New York&mdash;say, Sweeny, Tweed, Brennan, Hoffman, etc.,
etc. The rival candidates for the Presidency will all try to
get men drawn into their interests. Let us keep our power
by holding ourselves free.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The time is rapidly approaching when
we must select a candidate for the Presidency, and so far
as the State is concerned we are all at sea. The judgment of
our political friends seems to be in favor of the nomination
of Gov. H. Seymour, and unless some objection be presented
to him of which we have not heretofore heard I think our
State will declare for him on the 20th proximo. We regard
his declination as simply a manifestation of his personal
desires on the subject, and not as denying his name and
services to the country; at all events, we deny his right to
control his friends to that extent, and unless his home friends
deem it inexpedient we shall urge his nomination.</p>

<p>"I do not regard his chances of success as in the least
impaired by what has occurred in the West. Mr. Pendleton
is a good man, of high attainments, but I fear he has started
an issue on which we cannot unite; at all events, it cannot
be made the leading issue. The restoration of the ten absent
States to the Union, with the rights and privileges of the
other States, and with their local governments in the hands
of their white population, must be the absorbing question.
All else must be subordinate and secondary. The Democratic
party will protect the good faith and honor of the
nation as well in reference to the public debt as in reference
to all other questions.</p>

<p>"What is the prevailing sentiment in your State? Is it
in favor of Gov. Seymour; if not, to whom does it tend?
Gen. Hancock would do right well for the second place, but
I do not think our people are inclined to go for him for the

with indescribable misery.</p>

repeated that so far from having any antipathy against your
man, he rather likes him; used some strong terms of commendation,
and says that unless by some slip nothing will
appear to his personal disadvantage. Indeed, he seemed to
agree to my hint that he might best avoid sneering at any one
who was a favorite with any so as to keep all in good humor.
He would like very well to get your man in. The whole

next Presidential nomination suggested by you the other
evening, and am seriously of opinion that I know of no one
more able, or who would nearer meet all the requirements
of the present crisis than yourself. The selection of any
such names as those you mentioned would bring up <i>old</i>

or four cardinal points, viz.:</p>

<p>"1. Cheerfully accord freedom to the negro, and equality
before the law; but no <i>universal</i> negro suffrage, nor <i>domination</i>
of the negro over the white man.</p>

<p>"2. No cavilling about the national debt, however incurred;
that is sacred as honor, and must be paid, principal
and interest.</p>

<p>"3. No further patching of the Constitution of the country,
nor curtailing the independence of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>"4. The present erroneous expenditures of the genl. government
shall be reduced, and taxes equalized and diminished,
and tax-gatherers shall no longer be suffered to pry
into domestic affairs nor count the spoons.</p>

<p>"If such a platform could be put out and <i>stuck</i> to, not
dragged out into <i>side</i> issues, or <i>dead</i> issues, success would be
sure; so it appears to me; but if I am only another instance
of the side allusion above, it would not be strange; but I
would like such a nomination as proposed&mdash;there could be
none better.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Feb. 28th, 1868</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Two successive absences, between which
I was in town but one day and passed that ill in bed, have
prevented an earlier answer to your letters.</p>

<p>"I concur in your judgment that the paramount issue in
the coming election would be 'the restoration of the ten
absent States to the Union, with all the rights and privileges
of the other States, and with their local government in the
hands of the white population; and that all else must be
subordinate and secondary.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>"Our position must be <i>condemnation and reversal of negro
supremacy</i> in the ten States (added to that in Tennessee),
created by the measures of the Federal government&mdash;<i>first</i>,
by disfranchising the whites and overawing them by military
force, and, <i>secondly</i>, by admitting the blacks and organizing
them through the Freeman's Bureau, not only involving us
in a partnership in self-government with a mass of voters
(in all the U. S. over 900,000), confessedly incompetent at
the present time to exercise the suffrage wisely or safely,
and without any of the training, habits, or aspirations of
freemen, but, by thus obtaining control of nearly one-third
of the Senate and nearly one-quarter of the House, establishing
a practical dominion of the same character over the
great free States of the North and over the whole country.</p>

<p>"Associated with this issue are all those measures by
which the Senate is to be packed by the admission of new
States&mdash;the subdivision of the present States&mdash;added to the
control of 20 from the ten States and others constituting a
Senatorial dynasty of long tenure, and the usurpation by the
Senate thus constituted of the opportunity, power, and the
absorption by it and the House of the rightful authorities of
the Executive and of the Judiciary.</p>

<p>"In my judgment, if we obscure or weaken this issue, we
shall not only fail to meet the necessities of the present condition
of the country, but we shall commit a great political
blunder.</p>

<p>"On no other question can we be so unanimous among
ourselves. On no other question can we draw so much
from the other side and from the undetermined. It appeals
peculiarly to the adopted citizens, whether Irish or Germans;
to all the working-men; to the young men just becoming
voters. The Republican party contains large numbers who
are naturally hampered by its position on this issue; and
large numbers of old Federal and old Whig antecedents, who
do not think that any poor man, white or black, ought to
vote; and though they may go along with their party on the
theory that the blacks are a counterpoise to the adopted
citizens, their hearts misgive them. The pride of a superior
race and self-esteem, well founded in this case, are a universal
power.</p>

<p>"The more we concentrate the public attention on this
issue, so that the people will act with reference to it, the
better our chance of success will be.</p>

<p>"Subordinate, but next in importance, is the financial
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"The best aspect of that is its connection with the other
issue. It is now costing the country, directly and indirectly,
100 millions a year&mdash;perhaps as much even as the whole
interest on the public debt&mdash;to carry on the reconstruction
system and the measures associated with it. The army expenses
are now about 144 millions, exclusive of pensions.</p>

<p>"The best policy on the finances is a general attack on
the prodigality and corruption of the present governing
power. Our promises should be purification&mdash;reduction of
the army and navy, diminution of expenses, and remission
of taxes.</p>

<p>"I inquired into the state and prospects of the finances
when in Washington, and am satisfied that the expenditures
are now running at a rate much larger than the public are
aware of. And the tendency is to a fall of the revenues. I
do not&mdash;"(the rest wanting).</p>

it was true policy to avoid naming a candidate, and none

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 5th is rec'd. 'Mayor
Spriggs and the younger Kernans' all pleased with your
congratulations and commendations; and think they at the
next election can do better even than at the last.</p>

<p>"Gov. Seymour is all right as to health. If he is the
next Presidential candidate there need be no fear, in my
judgment, in reference to his health.</p>

<p>"The Governor is not in our district, and I have not seen
him for several weeks, as I have been mostly from home at
court; but I do not think he should or will be a delegate at
the approaching State convention. Nor should he, in my
opinion, be a delegate in the national convention. We should
not allow him to be a delegate to the national convention.
This would be regarded as evidence that he was not to be our
Presidential candidate in any contingency.</p>

<p>"Mr. D. C. Grove, editor of the <i>Observer</i>, is the delegate
to the State convention from this district. He will be disposed
to do whatever our friends shall deem best. Mr.
Spriggs and I mean to be in Albany Tuesday night to aid,
if we can, in consultation.</p>

<p>"In my judgment we should not in the State convention
lay down anything like a platform of principles; leave this
to the national convention.</p>

<p>"We might very properly in brief and well-considered
resolutions denounce the revolutionary schemes and measures
of the Radicals; declare our convictions that our institutions
and the peace and prosperity of the country are in danger;
and call upon the people at the coming election to elect men
and declare in favor of principles who and which will restore
the country to peace and prosperity and preserve American
constitutional liberty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>"I do not think that as a party we should take any part
in the struggle now going on between President Johnson and
the men who elected him.</p>

<p>"In reference to the candidate for President. I think
we should select as delegates our wisest and most patriotic
men&mdash;men whose character will give them weight in the
national convention, and who will not be influenced in their
action by the views of any clique of interested politicians.</p>

<p>"Believing myself that Gov. Seymour is our best man for
the times and our strongest man for the canvass, I hope the
delegation will be composed of men friendly to his nomination.</p>

<p>"It seems to me also that the State convention should, in
proper terms, in reference to other States and other candidates,
give expression to the confidence in and preference for
Governor Seymour as the Presidential nominee.</p>

<p>"I have made above suggestions in haste, and will be
happy to compare views with you and others at Albany. Let
us try to act wisely, for in my judgment everything depends
upon our success in the next election. This country cannot
stand another four years of the Sumners, Weeds, etc.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The newspapers report Gov. Seymour
as saying that under no circumstances would he consent to
become a candidate for the Presidency. I sincerely hope
this report is not literally correct. Such a determination
would be a great misfortune for the country, and, in my
judgment, a wrong to the reputation of Gov. S. The
whole country understands and respects his aversion to the
attitude of a candidate for the nomination, but it will never
do for him to say that he will not run if nominated, or serve
if elected. He may think that there is no inclination to
nominate him; if so, he is mistaken. As the case now stands,
he would certainly be selected, and his late speech will add
greatly to his strength. Mr. Pendleton, it is true, seems
to have strength by reason of his green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>back issue, but that
issue will not live till the 4th of July, nor will it bear examination
at any time. I perceive that Mr. McMaster, of
your city, who attended our convention, intimates that our
vote will be cast for Mr. P. He is totally mistaken. One
5th or 6th of the delegates may, at present, prefer Mr. P.,
but I am convinced that by the time of the convention he
will have no party at all. But the friends of Gov. Seymour
desire to talk about him, and the almost unbroken
reply is that he is the right man; but he declines, and we
must look for some one else. Now, we must not be left in
this position. Your letter is enough, but it is dated prior
to his last declination and before the State convention, and
as he was not presented it may be said that the Democracy
of your State are not for him. There has been, as you may
be aware, an attempt to make a movement for Mayor Hoffman,
at Phila., but I do not think it will extend, even with
Seymour out of the way. The delegates from the South will
seek to act with N. Y. and Pa., and will do what these States
desire. I <i>know</i> this to be the general sentiment, and when
Gov. Seymour's late speech is circulated it will awaken
much enthusiasm for his nomination.</p>

<p>"I had intended to visit you after our convention, but I
was unwell and had to return home. We had things our own
way. The young Democracy yielded the convention to the
older men of the party.</p>

men upon trains of thought which they will work out for
themselves. This gives to a speech its highest value. But a
few things can be said in a speech, and if it fails to be suggestive
to the hearers or readers it does but little good. Beyond
anything I have read in a long time your words at

him during his brief stay in Paris.</p>

<p>"Though withdrawn from politics, I have not lost my
interest in things at home, and therefore I write a few lines
confidentially.</p>

<p>"I notice a disposition in some quarters&mdash;how extensive
it is I have no means of knowing&mdash;to confine the approaching
contest to a single issue&mdash;constitutional or unconstitutional
government. It would be a fatal error. The contest
will be severe; and, if the conservative men of the country
are faultless in their tactics, it will nevertheless be close.
They cannot afford to dispense with the strength they would
derive from opposition to practical abuses, which are apart
from constitutional questions&mdash;the financial and commercial
mismanagement, and the reckless expenditure by Congress.
To ignore these issues would be to dishearten all the
friends of honest reform in the administration of the government
and make them passive spectators of the contest.</p>

<p>"The power of the old Albany regency consisted in the
frankness and intrepidity with which they met all public
questions. The people never give their confidence to artful
dodgers. Nothing will save you but a bold, manly policy.
You ought to take ground in language not to be misunderstood:</p>

<p>"1. In favor of bringing back the Southern States on the
same terms as the others.</p>

<p>"2. Of maintaining inviolate the public credit.</p>

<p>"3. Of returning as speedily as possible to specie payments,
and of reducing forthwith the paper circulation.</p>

<p>"4. Of repealing, simultaneously with the resumption of
specie payment, the act of Congress making paper a legal-tender.</p>

<p>"5. Of reducing the enormous duties on imports, which
are destroying our commerce, and will ultimately react most
injuriously on our agriculture and manufactures; and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>"6. Of reducing the public expenditure by a rigid system
of economy and lightening the burden of taxation.</p>

<p>"Nor will this be sufficient, unless you present to the people,
as the exponents of these principles, men who are known
to be their tried advocates, and who in the late Civil War
were active and unqualified supporters of the government.
With every advantage on the other side, Gen. Grant will
be a hard man to beat. It is but a few months since the
Democracy thought seriously of making him their candidate;
and there are multitudes who do not believe, and cannot
be made to believe, that he will favor ultra measures of
government, under whatever auspices he may be elevated to
power.</p>

left there last evening. I did not see the President, as
Randall thought it best that I should not. Had two conversations
with Randall&mdash;one in the morning, the other in the
afternoon. Between the two conferences the Governor had
an interview with the President in relation to the future
action of the administration. Randall said no action could
be taken in regard to consolidating against Grant until
after the 26th. The Johnson men would be glad to have a
conference with you and your friends in New York at any
time you would name after the 26th here in N. Y. The
first name he mentioned, upon which a consolidation could be
effected, was Ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>ncock. Afterwards mentioned Chase, as
upon him more Senators could be brought than upon the
former. He mentioned the names of several Senators who
would support Chase beside the Republican non-impeachers.
He asserted positively that Chase would accept a nomination
from the Democrats and Conservatives. That Chase's negro
antecedents could be got along with by adopting a plank in
the platform giving each State, or rather conceding to each
State, the management of the franchise question. He also
said that should Chase be nominated there would be no lack
of 'material aid' to carry on the campaign successfully.</p>

<p>"My opinion is that if our convention could be brought
to nominate Chase, with Hancock, we would sweep the country,
and on the fourth of March next have a working majority
in the Senate.</p>

<p>"Randall also suggested that you get some of your commercial
men to write to the acquitting Senators, thanking
them in the name of the great interests of N. Y. for their
votes, and especially Senator Grimes.</p>

<p>"I hope that the proposed conference will be held, believing,
as I do, that it will result in the overthrow of the political
ascendency of the Radicals; at all events, it can do no
harm, as I am entirely satisfied that the Johnson interest
would see the Democracy succeed rather than the Rads, even
if they are not recognized.</p>

<p>"The <i>Times</i> of this morning copies an article from the
<i>Argus</i>, and, if I can read the article and understand it
aright, it is a feeler in this very direction.</p>

<p>"I shall publish a leader, when I return home, of the
same import, but a little plainer, without mentioning any
names, and we will see what comes of it.</p>

<p>"One other thing. Randall intimated to me that the
President and Smythe were not on as good terms as they
might be. The President did not take his last offer to do a
certain thing, provided he would give him the <i>mission to
Australia</i>. The President thought it would have been better
in Smythe to have paid up arrearages before asking further
favors.</p>

</p>

<p>"Public opinion is being rapidly formed in relation to
the candidate for the Presidency at the next election. Your
position is potential in influence. I take the liberty of addressing
you in advance of the convention to urge upon you
and through you upon our Democratic friends to insist, with
all our State and Democratic pride, prestige, and weight
of influence upon the nomination of Gov. Seymour unless
fairly overruled. Gov. Seymour's course during the war
was so nobly sound and Democratic that he attained a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>very
strong hold upon the confidence and affections of the Democracy
of this and of all Northern and Western States.
His name will, I assure you, develop a hearty enthusiasm
among Democrats that can be drawn out by no other. The
hope of winning friends from our adversaries by taking up
a man who has been identified with the other party finds
little encouragement in our past experience. Those who do
not hate the Radicals worse than they do Democrats will
continue to vote with them. It will not be love, but its
opposite, that will control their action. Let us stand by our
principles and by those who have maintained them when
trampled under foot by the despotism inspired and prompted
by war. Chase's record is not a good one; it has great defects.
Ambitious politicians may deem his acquisition a
bargain; but I tell you his name has no strength with Democrats.
That pride, in and for the men and for the principles
which he has assisted us to sustain in dark times, which
Seymour's name would command, will be thrown away without
him, and especially with a candidate so recently a leading
man in the administration of Mr. Lincoln. The election
of Lincoln, taken with all its consequences, was about the
greatest calamity that ever befell a great nation. The Democracy
all over the land, though hushed to silence by the
war spirit, feel it to be so. They ache for an opportunity
to show their zeal and their strength. I have no doubt but
that Seymour's scruples may be overcome if he deems the
interests of the country at stake. I must say that I think
his unqualified declension has been injurious to his success
in being nominated, but not in being elected if nominated.</p>

<p>"In my judgment, Pendleton's name stands next to Seymour,
though I suppose N. Y. city thinks otherwise. His
theory, as he himself explained it, was not so very objectionable
as some of the N. Y. financiers seem to suppose, but
the answer and cure of all that question between greenbacks
and gold will be settled under a Democratic administration
very shortly by the resumption of specie payments, and this
is and should be the only answer to it. With Seymour at
the head, take Hendrix for vice. With Pendleton, take,
possibly, C. F. Adams, or, better still, our own Church. I
believe the Democracy have the power and the will to restore
the government to common-sense and the Constitution
to its position as the fundamental law of the land, and I
believe it must [be] done through the agency [of] men
who have not swerved from their principles, whether in
peace or War.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">"<span class="smcap">Washn.</span>, <i>June 5th, '68</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;I send another missive from Frank
by which you will see his hopes are revived. You asked
me to keep you posted, and therefore I send these advices,
as they come to me intended only for me. I think the Chase
fever will die out and will help Frank in the end. I wrote
Barlow yesterday, who seems, by the way, to be <i>enthused</i>
about it, that it was regarded here as an attempt like Pendleton's
to subordinate the great constitutional questions involved
in the reconstruction measures&mdash;a question which
is fundamental and will determine whether this is to be a
free govt. or not&mdash;and the subordinate one of whether the
debt was to be paid in gold or greenbacks. It is impossible
that the public mind shall make such a diversion, and those
who attempt it are swayed by personal, not public, interests,
and can have no real hold on the country, and no comprehension
of the serious mood in which the people are at this
moment. You, who really believe in the people and have
faith, a real faith, in the Democratic philosophy, can comprehend
how dangerous it is for the leaders of a great party
to trifle with this subject, and that it is trifling with it to
set up a man as the representative of a cause who has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
heart in it, and only because he has quarrelled with his
own party for their daring to prefer another man.</p>

<p>"The Chase spasm will help Frank by loosening up of
the party feeling and antagonizing Pendleton. If any
Democrat can go for Chase <i>a priori</i> they can go for Blair,
and Frank<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> will carry just 10 Republican votes for every
one that Chase can carry; for Chase has not the slightest
influence with the only class of Republicans who are disposed
to go with us, viz., the Lincoln men. He was an active
Radical, and the Lincoln men would delight to have him
beaten. He was the only human being that I believe Lincoln
actually hated. Our running Chase would fix thousands
to Grant, who would certainly go for us with Frank
as a leader, Frank being really the true heir to Lincoln.
Lincoln sent for him from the army to defend him and to
assail Chase on the floor of the House of Representatives,
and Lincoln, you remember, published his letter to me requesting
my brother to leave his command and take his seat
in the House of Reps., promising to restore him his commission
as soon as military operations were resumed, which
he did to the chagrin of all Chase men.</p>

<p>"I had a great contest to get into the convention. The
B. &amp; O. R. R. and Pendletonians exerted themselves to the
utmost to defeat me, but by the sheer pressure of public
opinion in Baltimore I was carried through. At every mention
of my name in the convention the immense hall rang
with the applause of the people, and I got 18 of 21 city
delegates, altho' every man of them had been pledged against
me.</p>

"<i>Confidential.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;"><span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>May 30, 1868</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When you were last in Washington you
were pleased to ask my views as to the candidate who ought
to be nominated by the Democratic convention for the Presiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>cy.
I gave you my opinions then very briefly, but the
great events which have transpired since that period have,
in my judgment, settled the question conclusively. Our
strongest man, and the only one who can <i>certainly</i> be elected,
is Genl. W. S. Hancock.</p>

<p>"My reasons are as follows:</p>

<p>"1st. Pennsylvania is the most doubtful State in the
Union, and has always decided contested Presidential elections.
The reason is not only the closeness of her vote and
the great number of her electors, but that her State elections
precede by three weeks those in other States, and thus influence
beyond calculation the result of the Presidential election.
Hancock is the only man who can carry that State.
His nomination from that moment would give us the prestige
of certain success there, and a probable majority of
50,000 in our favor in the October election, which would
immensely influence other States in November following. He
is a Pennsylvanian by birth and education, and by far the
most popular of her soldiers. He commanded in person
more of her troops than any other man, leading them always
to victory, especially at Gettysburg, to Pennsylvania the
decisive battle of the war.</p>

<p>"2nd. About one-third of all the voters of the North were
soldiers during the recent war. Recognizing this, the radical
party have nominated Grant. We must receive a large
proportion of that vote in the coming contest or we are defeated.
No Democratic candidate can receive anything like
so large a proportion of this vote as Hancock. From the
commencement to the close of the war he has commanded,
in person, over three hundred thousand troops, and both
officers and men were greatly attached to him. His military
record during the war was most brilliant, and will bear the
closest scrutiny and the most favorable comparison with
that of Grant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>"3rd. He would be more acceptable to the South than
any other military candidate, many prominent Southern
leaders and newspapers having announced their preference
for him. Especially is this the case with her wisest men,
because, whilst recognizing his sound Democratic principles,
success is to <i>them</i> a necessity, and they believe that his
nomination would make our victory certain. They do not
support him with reluctance, but with enthusiasm. His
humane, able, and statesmanlike administration of the affairs
of the 5th military district, at a time when all seemed
lost, when every other military leader had either gone over
to the enemy or concealed his views, gained him their respect
and admiration.</p>

<p>"4th. Hancock has from his youth up always been a
Democrat. In taking him we do not rely upon a man of
doubtful or vacillating principles, but one of our faith, with
the firmness and the courage to maintain it.</p>

<p>"5th. Hancock, I believe, would make a President of
whom not only our party, but our country, would be proud.
He would unite and strengthen the party, and his firmness,
good judgment, and total disregard of political trickery
would lead us safely through the coming crisis of our national
affairs.</p>

<p>"6th. No man can foreshadow the events of the next
four years. Are they to be peaceful or warlike? And how
is the latter condition to be avoided? We must nominate
a man who can certainly be elected, and whose name at the
head of our Presidential ticket, whilst giving us the prestige
of certain success in that campaign, will give us strength to
carry the Congressional elections. Has any such man been
thought or spoken of except Hancock? I have heard of
none. Besides, you will recollect that, by unconstitutional
legislation, Grant has been made the virtual commander-in-chief
of the <i>armies</i> of the United States. We must have for
his commander-in-chief a man who has the ability, the courage,
and the firmness to command him. Such a man is
Genl. Hancock.</p>

<p>"This will be the great struggle for the supremacy of one
or the other great party of the country. A written Constitution
against a popular, if not a military, despotism. If we
fail now we may be lost forever, for a civil war alone could
tear down the barriers which the Radical party would erect
against our liberties. They would then have, as now, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Senate and the House, the legislative departments. Then,
as now, by similar intimidation, carried to a greater excess
by their victory, they would suspend the functions, as they
pleased, of the Supreme Court, the judicial department.
They would have also the executive department, thus securing
substantially all the departments of the government.
Do you doubt the extent to which they would carry their
revolutionary doctrines? And would the Senate any longer
be a curb upon the frenzy of the House, with an addition
of 20 members from the negro-ized South? We must start
out, casting aside all personal preferences and prejudices,
determined to succeed. We must select the man who can
secure the most votes, and who will be supported with enthusiasm
by every Democrat, war or peace, so-called, by
every conservative Democrat or Republican soldier, and by
the thousands of new recruits and conservative Republicans.
I think that Genl. W. S. Hancock is the only man who would
receive the combined, enthusiastic support of the people
South and North.</p>

<p>"I know that, if you concur with me in these views, you
will not hesitate to use every effort to secure by this means
the success of that party which is dear to us both. I have
written you because I knew that you would not misconstrue
my motives, and because I believe that you can exert great
influence for the good of our country. If there be reasons
which I may have overlooked, in forming a deliberate judgment
upon a subject which has caused me much anxious
thought, I should be very much pleased to hear them from
a friend like yourself. Let us have harmony in our councils,
and with wisdom success is ours.</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO THE TAMMANY SOCIETY</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"<i>July, 1868.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;Regretting that I cannot personally attend
the celebration of the Fourth of July by the Tammany
Society, to which you have invited me, I nevertheless concur
most cordially in the patriotic sentiments so eloquently expressed
in the address of the sachems.</p>

<p>"Your venerable society may well felicitate itself upon
its political retrospect. It did everything in its power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
avert civil strife by a policy which was represented as too
conciliatory by those who did not comprehend the danger.
When the conflict of arms came it cordially maintained the
nationality of our people in a confederated republic, which
Jefferson and Madison and Jackson always held to be incapable
of being dissolved except by a revolutionary destruction
of the Constitution. And now that peace has once
more happily returned, it claims that constitutional rights
shall be restored throughout our whole country; that every
State shall be replaced in its constitutional orbit; that we
shall once more present to the world a continental system of
States, bound together by a constitutional union&mdash;founded
on the twin principles of local self-government and industrial
liberty, and sustained by the voluntary action of a
people among whom government is everywhere carried on
by the consent of the governed.</p>

<p>"Alas! that this benign work of peace should be more
difficult than the fierce struggle of war. But so it is.</p>

<p>"Multitudes of our fellow-citizens are so infatuated with
fear of the danger of disunion, which has now passed, that
they create a danger of centralism fatal to all liberty&mdash;to
all constitutional government&mdash;and at last by inevitable reaction
to the Union itself.</p>

<p>"Instead of restoring the system of our fathers, the purpose
to do which alone consecrated our cause against secession
as righteous, they would erect upon this fair continent
eleven Polands, eleven Hungaries, eleven Irelands!</p>

<p>"And the same principles of despotism which they would
apply to our recent enemies they freely extend to the whole
Northern people.</p>

<p>"I say the principles of despotism. For <i>centralism</i> is
<i>despotism</i>. Was centralism ever before so rampant as now?
The distinguishing characteristic of the controlling element
of the so-called Republican party which now sways the two
Houses of Congress is a total disregard of all limitations of
power established by our written Constitution; an overwhelming
contempt for all fundamental law, whether State
or Federal.</p>

<p>"No right of localities or of individuals is deemed sacred.</p>

<p>"The principles which underlie our whole political system
are not respected; they do not seem to be even comprehended.</p>

<p>"The present Congress and the advanced Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
party are a rule unto themselves. Their own opinion of
what it is convenient or expedient they should do, is the
only limitation of power which they acknowledge; and it is
their opinion that they should do pretty much everything,
in all places and with respect to everybody.</p>

<p>"Of course, such a false system of political philosophy
does now, as it has in all ages, immediately degenerate into
selfish rapacity. Congress is mainly occupied in putting
new manacles on the trade and industry of the country; and
the more respectable representatives of the prevalent political
ideas are voting money out of everybody's pockets into
their own.</p>

<p>"In this condition of things nothing but the principles of
the Democratic party, as maintained by Jefferson and Jackson,
can save the country. There is no organized agency
which can give effects to these principles except the Democratic
party, with such alliances as it may form in the cause
of liberal government.</p>

<p>"From the day of the accession of President Johnson
I have felt renewed confidence that the American people
would not only maintain our national unity, but would reconstruct
our political institutions on their ancient foundations.</p>

<p>"The political ideas of Jefferson and Jackson in which
President Johnson was educated, and which have become
incarnated in his very nature&mdash;the character of the work
he was providentially called to undertake in bringing back
into our system the people of eleven States lately in revolt,
which he could only do by addressing the intellects and sentiments
of that people&mdash;were guarantees that he would recur
to the original fountains of our American principles of
government.</p>

<p>"As for us, we could not but accept what we had sought
when we endeavored to elect McClellan: first, the re-establishment
of national unity; secondly, the starting the restored
government in its new career upon its original and
true principles.</p>

<p>"The situation controls. Not the plans or wishes of individuals.</p>

<p>"In my judgment, neither President nor the Democratic
party could stop what events so clearly commanded.</p>

<p>"Last year, at your Fourth-of-July celebration, I promised
him in your name, in the name of the Democratic
party, and of your acclamations, a li<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>beral co-operation in
the great work; and afterwards repeated that assurance in
person.</p>

<p>"The time has now come when all parties who favor
President Johnson's plan of pacification must act with reference
to the election of the next Congress.</p>

<p>"President Johnson will now be under the necessity of
appealing to the whole body of the people, accepting all who
come to him on the issue he has made, and separating from
all who go against him on that issue.</p>

<p>"If he should attempt the narrow and futile scheme,
urged upon him by those who are neither his friends nor the
friends of his cause&mdash;of carrying out his policy through the
exclusive agency of the Republican party, in case he can
capture it and convert it to his purposes&mdash;he will find his
machine turned against him in the hour of his need. He
will find himself, like the unfortunate object of Turkish
jealousy, tied up in a bag, to be silently strangled. I do not
doubt that he will act on the larger policy which would have
governed Andrew Jackson or Henry Clay under like circumstances.
He will cast himself upon the whole body of
our people, leaving parties and organizations to take care
of themselves. He will be triumphantly sustained.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party should pursue a liberal policy in
all its action, and accept as brethren all who stand with it
on the present issue. It is too powerful to be jealous. It
has too great a motive in the restoration of its own traditional
principles of government to an ascendency in the
councils of the country, which they made great, prosperous,
and happy, to think of anything less grand or less noble.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;The day after I got to New York
Bennett sent his carriage to take me out to dine with him.
He did not talk favorably of Chase, but as an antagonist of
Seymour, whom he considered to be at heart opposed to him.
He spoke well of Frank, and intimated a purpose to support
him if nominated. The day before I left the city Montgomery
and myself called at his office. He said he would
have supported Frank cordially, but insisted that now it was
Grant vs. Seymour, and the former w'd succeed. His son,
in whom all his hopes and affections are bound up, is greatly
attached to Frank. Is it not worth while to work on the old
man's personal vanity and his ambition for his son's advancement
in the party's consideration to get him into line
to help our cause? Lawrence Jerome is devoted to Frank,
and Bennett's son to him. Jerome is out for Frank, although
he once subscribed to Grant. I think through him, by proper
management, we might get hold of the <i>Herald</i>. Whatever
may be thought or said of this fickle print, it is a power in
the body politic through its vast circulation. I think it
might be led to make a transit to Seymour by means of
its inclinings to Frank; and Jerome would be a safe conduct
in this matter, as he and Bennett were both shipped once
for Grant, but now prefer my hero. They want a hero, and
so does our cause; and although Frank is a mighty small
young Hickory, he is the best we can now command. Do try
and make something of these suggestions; we have so good
a cause, and its success is so essential to the welfare of the
country, that some condescensions to the old Plutus (or
Pluto, if you please) might be a cheap purchase of a three
months' command of his columns. If my scribblings in them
could be of use in reviving memories of the Jackson-Van
Buren era and the prosperous times it brought about for the
Republic, I would give a part of every day to inveigh against
the monstrous doings of the banditti that now set up for a
Congress&mdash;and it would be by way of contrast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>"I believe the convention, although it seems to have been
by accident, really made the wisest disposition, both as to
the ticket and the platform that could have been devised.
Seymour's eloquence and polish and moderation has a happy
influence to recommend us to the refined and all who are
apprehensive of rash counsels in this crisis. Frank's boldness
and thorough grasp of all the issues which are looked
to as necessary to put the Democracy at once in possession
of the good, will do much to rally to our standard all the
zealots for the instant overthrow of the corrupt military despotism
that now lords it over the land.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have given much thought to the subject
of organization. I am satisfied a new course must be
taken. I do not count in any degree upon the national committee.
It will do nothing from the nature of its organization.
We have been a long time out of power, and are apt
to call upon those who used to be efficient without making
allowance for the change made by time. We only need
organization. The moment we get it we shall become aggressive.
We can get no vigorous organization without putting
our young men into the field. To do this we must give
them a motive as well as a method for action. This has been
done in New Jersey and Connecticut by the Jackson clubs.
They are, to a degree, secret organizations. This gives
them the charm of novelty, as we have heretofore had nothing
of the kind on our side. They hold out a motive to the
active young men, as they give to them power at once in
their localities. James Spencer, Esq., of New York, and
Mr. Palmer, of Wisconsin, called upon me last week with
a plan of the kind, which I think is the right thing. They
are both good organizers. This scheme is the most efficient,
and costs the least. When a club is formed it is not only
self-sustaining, but it does a great deal of work at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>its own
cost. If men are sent at once into Maine, Indiana, Ohio,
and Pennsylvania they will in a little time give such a start
to the movement that it will go on of itself. Time is everything,
and it is my opinion any other method should be
dropped and this plan entered upon. It has freshness,
economy, and simplicity to recommend it. It appeals to
young men, as it gives them something to do, and also gives
them strength and power in their towns. I wish you would
see Messrs. Spencer and Palmer when they call upon you.
I am quite well now, but I am suffering with the rest of
mankind from the heat. I am overwhelmed with letters.
Of course, all I get are very satisfactory. Our papers should
keep up a steady fire upon the subjects of debt, taxation,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;Your Milwaukee speech has done
me much good&mdash;a thing not to be thought of if it were not
that this good done to one obscure individual extends to the
whole country, when everybody is alike advantaged as I am.
Your exposure of the terrible cost the whole nation is put to
in maintaining an army to hold one portion of it in subjection
makes it plain that the entire commonwealth is subjected.
That section of ours which bears the tax (more
than England and France both bear to enslave two empires),
to keep the South under the foot of our quondam
slaves, certainly gets less for its money, although laid out
in producing a very thorough despotism, than the imperial
dynasties abroad. You have made a capital demonstration
of the enormity of the flight into tyranny which
our Radicals have made in a short time, from the vantage-ground
they obtained in the war over our free govt. The
North sells itself into debt and slavery to enslave the
South.</p>

<p>"But I owe you something more than the commonalty for
your speech&mdash;your making my son a great man, giving him
the heirship of Old Hickory's glory, although I know it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>is
far beyond his reach, fills me with delight. You put a
brilliant rainbow before my eyes, and tell me there is a pot
of gold where it stands on the earth. The vision pleases,
however, sensible that no effort will find its footing on the
ground. Yet I hope Frank's aspirations will not all prove
delusions to him or his father. He has all Old Hickory's
devotion to his country, and he has the courage to attempt
its redemption from the hands of the banditti that has for
the time seized on all its wealth and all the defences of its
liberties, and I have faith in a providence to overrule it, so
that my young stripling who is put forward in the battle
against the Philistines may do some execution with his
sling.</p>

<p>"I beg you write me a line to say what promise you bring
from the West. I have some influence with Bennett. If you
think well of it I will write to him and urge him to open
his columns to us. I think if Frank made well-considered
speeches Bennett would <i>Herald</i> them.</p>

Mr. Welles is now at the Kittery Yard in person, and will
not be here for a week perhaps. He has probably done
what Shaw and friends ask. If not, 'twill be too late to act,
I fear, on his return. Welles is very earnestly with us now,
and I have no doubt will do anything he can. My accounts
from the West agree with yours as respects political prospects
there. But Able, who is not of a sanguine temperament,
writes that our friends are going to carry Missouri
by 20,000 majority.</p>

<p>"From Maine, Mr. Clapp, former M. C. from Portland,
a brother of Mrs. Woodbury, who is also a cautious man, is
very confident of gains in the State.</p>

<p>"If my father can go on to New York I am sure he will
do so, to see Bennett. The truth is, however, that Bennett
looks <i>to position</i>, and there is no getting him without assurances
of it. It was in this way that Lincoln got him. He
could have been nominated to Paris undoubtedly if he had
not himself declined accepting the mission, because he would
have been rejected. Chase got his support, I am sure, by
promising him this mission if he was elected. The negotiation
with Lincoln was carried on through a fellow of the
name of Bartlett, who was the same man who got the <i>Herald</i>
for Fr&eacute;mont. I had no part in either negotiation, but I
knew of both and sustained Lincoln in keeping his bargain
with Bennett. His inclinations are with our side, I am sure,
and he told my father and myself he would have supported
Frank's nomination earnestly.</p>

<p>"I would not hesitate myself in supporting him if he
would give us the power of his press to elect our ticket. I
regard him as every way a most reputable man, and one
of far greater ability than Chief-Justice Chase. I said this
to one of Chase's hangers-on one day when he was turning
up his eyes at Lincoln's appointment of Bennett.</p>

<p>"If Seymour could support Chase for the Presidency
for his doings about impeachment I cannot see why he could
not appoint Bennett for helping to save the country.</p>

<p>"Seymour ought not, under any circumstances, to be
approached on this matter. But I think we might legitimately
hold out hopes to Bennett and keep our promise of
support in good faith. I would, for myself, unhesitatingly
offer to do my utmost to get the President to appoint him,
though I would not offer that Seymour himself should come
under any promise about it, or indeed be approached on the
subject directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The canvass has run on for more than
two months, and the questions of the day have been discussed
in journals and meetings by so many different minds,
and in so many different modes, that they are somewhat
confused in the public understanding. Would it not [be]
well if at this moment we could get a fresh presentation of
our purposes in a way that will arrest public attention and
in a way that will meet the points urged by our opponents,
as we now have a need of their position? I have been talking
the matter over with Mr. McCormick, in whose judgment
I have great confidence. Now, every candidate for
the Presidency must have a 'privy council.' There must
be a number of men upon whom he can lean, who will help
to shape out before election a line of policy which will carry
the country through its difficulties. Able, influential, and
thoughtful men should know now what they can rely upon
in the event of our success. With clear ideas on these points
they can work with more vigor, etc. Would it not be well
to have a meeting of ten or twelve persons who should talk
matters over clear through the coming year? Should not
some definiteness be given to our future plans? Could not
some position be taken now which will do good in the way
of foiling the attacks of our opponents? Up to this time,
with the exception of my consultations with you and two or
three others, I have been almost isolated in my position.
There are many advantages in this, but it should not be held

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 30 ult. is received. I see
nothing more to be done in Penna. beyond counteracting the
effects of the soldiers' meeting. This is a movement upon
which the Republicans count largely, and upon which they
have spent large sums of money. Now, the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of this
will not depend upon the soldiers, but the generals who will
be in attendance. Can this be done? Get Generals McClellan,
Hancock, Franklin to go to Philadelphia on Thursday
of next week. Give them a reception. There will be an immense
turn-out of the citizens. The Republican meeting
and the near approach of the election will furnish all the
stimulants needed. As it will be gotten up without parade
or all the notes of preparation which have gone before the
Republican show, it will tell more on the public minds.
The soldiers throughout the country look to see how the
popular generals go. We can make the best show in that
way. I learn that Hancock has not been asked by the
general committee to go into Penna. He is very strong
there. I fear we have neglected the soldiers too much. It
seems to me that some military exhibition on our side is the
only thing to be done before the Penna. elections. If it is
made a 'reception' of these generals it cannot be a failure,
as there will be a great turn-out to see them. General Slocum
should also be there. He can give aid in getting up

<p>"I have written to Genl. McClellan, asking him to go to
Penna. I felt a delicacy in doing so, but the necessity is
so great that I sent him the request by Mr. Mather. It will
do us great harm if he declines. Our people have looked
for his return with anxiety. He has more power in Penna.
than any living man. This I learned when I spoke there in
1864. His visit will wipe out the effect of the soldiers'
convention. As he was with me when Penna. was invaded,
he can do me much good. I did not feel I could in my letter
to him say as much as I felt. The soldiers are not inclined
to go for Grant. He slaughtered them too ruthlessly. With
many thousands of them McClellan's words will be words
of command. All my letters from Penna. say that his visit

while Davies would be content to have the law business. It
would enable me to make some money, and be a good thing
all around. I thought I would suggest it to you in strict
confidence, and <i>if you can accomplish it I feel sure it will

<p>In the first volume of my <i>Life of Tilden</i> (page <a href="#Page_226">226</a>) I
had occasion to refer to some of his reasons for declining
to withdraw from his candidacy for Governor in
favor of Mr. Church. The statements there made gave
offence to some of Mr. Church's political followers, which
found expression in one of the most devoted newspaper
organs of the Canal Ring in Syracuse. In the preceding
letter from Mr. Church the reader will find some additional
justification for the opinions above referred to, and which
helped to inspire Mr. Tilden's distrust of Mr. Church as a
leader of a party for reform.</p>

that remarkable executive ability which he manifested in
his profession, in business, and in the broader relations with
men in which he acted so important a part, but of his great

were evident to those who saw him intimately and were only

deferred to others and voluntarily limited his own sphere of

<h3>TILDEN TO ALBERT CARDOZO</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 24.5em;">"<i>Aug. 18, 1869.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;At the suggestion of a friend of Mr.
Russell Sage and of mine, I should attend on Tuesday next
in the Oyer and Terminer if I were not obliged to leave
town early to-morrow morning on business which will probably
make it impracticable for me to return in season.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances I beg leave to say to your
hearers as if upon that occasion some part of what I should
say if present.</p>

<p>"I think there can be no doubt that all the grounds of
the discrimination contemplated against Mr. Sage, as compared
with the other persons charged with having received
more than seven per cent. for the use of money&mdash;as those
grounds are reported in the public journals&mdash;are erroneous
in point of fact.</p>

<p>"The principal ground is the supposed participation of
Mr. Sage in the locking up of greenbacks. This allegation
is denied in the most positive and comprehensive manner
by an affidavit of Mr. Sage. That denial is corroborated
by affidavits of one or more persons most intimately acquainted
[with] his affairs. I find no difficulty in giving
full credence to these denials from my own knowledge of
Mr. Sage, his methods and habits of business, his transactions
and investments. They are all incompatible with his
being engaged in any such scheme. I have known him well
for years. He is about the last man to enter into any combination
which would limit the freedom of his individual
and personal action. He is not a lender of money as a
business or otherwise than of his temporary balances. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
interests are all in favor of elevating rather than of depressing
stocks, in which the bulk of his property is invested.
It would not need the affirmative proof which is offered to
make me totally discredit the representation that he was or
could be involved in a combination of the character and
objects imputed to him. Mr. Sage is a man of rare ability,
energy, and enterprise; and his use of these powers is all
in the way of building up, constructing, developing. I am
satisfied that there is not the slightest ground for imputing
to Mr. Sage anything beyond the mere fact of receiving
more than seven per cent. for the use of money. I hope that
you will consider it consistent with your duty to confine your
sentence to the fine which you have applied to the other
cases of the same character; and I am sure the judgment of
the bar and of the entire community will sanction such a
disposition of the case.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary, in my view of the matter, to discuss
the statute of 1837. It was peculiar in two respects: that
it reversed the equity rule which had prevailed always before
in this State and in England, that in cases of usury 'he
who seeks equity must do equity'; and that it added to the
forfeiture at law of the money loaned a criminal penalty.
I remember it in its origin, its authorship, and the circumstances
under which it came into being. It was then deemed
an extravagant and barbarous law. I have never known its
criminal feature enforced until now. I presume that nearly
all the community, as well as Mr. Sage, were ignorant of
the existence of a feature so anomalous in all jurisprudence.</p>

<p>"I beg to add that the case cannot be deemed one calling
for any exceptional rigor; nor do any circumstances of aggravation
exist to justify the infliction of a special indignity
upon a man of character like Mr. Sage, doing an act, not
<i>malum in se</i>, universally practised and universally tolerated.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On my return late Saturday night I
received yours of the 11th, and I take the earliest time at
my disposal to reply.</p>

<p>"The retainer to which you allude grew out of and related
to matters wholly distinct and disconnected from the
A. and G. W.,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and was arranged without any agency of
mine, and the subsequent payment of it was purely voluntary
on your part.</p>

<p>"No intimation was ever made to me that it had any
reference to or was to affect my relations to Mr. Flagg<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> as
trustee under the several mortgages of the A. and G. W.</p>

<p>"I cannot doubt that it was known to you that I had
acted as his counsel for more than a year previous. Nor
did I ever suspect that you did not perfectly understand
that I was still at liberty to do so.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, when Mr. McHenry<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> sought to retain me
in reference to his scheme for reorganizing the A. and G.
W., and asked me to name the amount&mdash;having looked into
all the relations of parties, and having considered his plan&mdash;I
declined to have anything to do with it in any manner
or for any purpose, and refused his retainer, repeatedly
pressed upon me.</p>

<p>"In one of these interviews I informed him that the
suits which had been commenced to foreclose the mortgages,
if, as I understood them to be, for I had not seen the papers,
were objectionable, that, if a sale were to be had, they must
be reformed or abandoned, and new suit in proper form,
and with proper parties, instituted; that Mr. Flagg&mdash;at the
instance of any bondholders, and possibly in an extreme case
without their instance&mdash;ought to intervene for that purpose.
To this view he yielded.</p>

<p>"When the lease proposed to be made by the receiver
was brought to my attention some weeks ago, the counsel of
the Erie called on me to ask my consideration of it as counsel
for Mr. Flagg and of the first mortgage bondholders.
He called on me to exercise my function in that capacity;
and had prolonged negotiations with me, not as an associate,
but as a representative of a different party.</p>

<p>"I heard no complaint until it happened that, while acting
as counsel for the trustees and bondholders, I did not
do precisely what their adversaries preferred to have done.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, I answer your question: You 'are not justified in
being surprised that I am acting for the trustee and his
bondholders "without notice"' to you. You had notice
all the time that I was at liberty so to act, and much of the
time that I was so acting. If you <i>are</i> surprised, you are
under some misapprehension as to the situation. I would
have omitted no courtesy towards you. I had no suspicion
that you did not understand my position exactly as I understand
it.</p>

<p>"When the question as to the proposed lease came before
me, suddenly and unexpectedly, it was with the declaration
of Mr. Meyer that he was 'opposed to it, unless I could
show him reasons to the contrary, which he did not think
I could.' I looked at it to see if I could devise modifications
which would make it safe for the bondholders.</p>

<p>"The difficulty of the case is the <i>short</i> and <i>uncertain</i>
duration of the lease. I was not able to see in it, <i>as drawn</i>,
sufficient guards to satisfy the bondholders. I spent a morning
with Mr. Lane and Mr. Meyer discussing amendments;
and we left for Ohio, with the understanding between him
and us that we should have a conference there upon the subject
of amendment. It was only when the motion was on
and the argument was about beginning that we learned to
our surprise that Mr. Backus had decided that no negotiation
for any modification would be entertained. So the
question had to be argued as it stood. Just before I left
Cleveland, Mr. Backus said to me that if we would recognize
the advance ($1,390,000) as to be ultimately paid, he
would do everything to give us security in the operation of
the lease; and, if, when I got to New York, it was thought
advisable to negotiate, he would come here on your request.
After my return I <i>did think</i> it advisable to consider the
question, and so said to Mr. Lane; but he declined. Shortly
after, the motion in Philadelphia, of which Mr. Cuyler had
given notice, in pursuance of a reservation he had caused to
be made in the original order, came on.</p>

<p>"I allude to these circumstances to show that I have
treated you fairly and considerately while in an adversary
position on this question of temporary lease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"One word as to Mr. Flagg. The payment of the $1000
for his services was due him, and should have been provided
for. I first called the attention of Col. Stebbins to it, and
then yours. The purchase of the bonds of Mr. Flagg&mdash;to
a trifling amount&mdash;was no greater favor than had been accorded
on a large scale to parties who had stood in the way
of the arrangement for the close of the receivership and the
making of the lease. That he had taken no selfish care for
himself did not seem any reason why he should be treated
with less consideration. I submitted the matter to you as
the proper party. You treated it with equity and courtesy.
You are entitled to the same spirit from Mr. Flagg. But
you could not have supposed that he would be unfaithful
in any respect to his trust.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, what the first mortgage bondholders
want is:</p>

<p>"1. That the suit for foreclosure should be prosecuted,
in proper form and with proper parties, to give a good title
at the sale, and that they be represented in these suits by
their own agent and not by agents of any adversary party.</p>

<p>"2. That, if a sale and purchase of the property be made
which operates to discharge their lien, with or without an
agreement for reorganization, the title be taken by satisfactory
agents for their security.</p>

<p>"That in the mean time the property be protected and
further debts in priority to their rights be avoided.</p>

better employed in devising a complete and permanent harmony

mistake.</p>

<h3>TILDEN&mdash;CIRCULAR OF THE STATE COMMITTEE</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>April 15th, 1870</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The election of a chief judge and six
associate judges of the Court of Appeals&mdash;which will take
place on the 17th of May&mdash;and the nomination, at the Democratic
State Convention to be held at Rochester on the 27th
of April, of our candidates for the chief judge and <i>four</i> of
the six associate judges, are events of great interest.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party has never hitherto failed to supply
in the court of last resort judges of undoubted moral
and official purity and integrity, who have commanded the
confidence and reverence of the whole people, and who have,
by their abilities and professional learning, illustrated the
jurisprudence of our State and country.</p>

<p>"In the present tendency of our times&mdash;towards a weakening
of the trust of the people in the judiciary&mdash;it is more
than ever important that we hold our standard of character
and qualifications <i>high</i>.</p>

<p>"A degradation of the administration of justice is the
last calamity of a republic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>"Distrust or doubt in the public mind as to the administration
of justice, even if unfounded, involves half the evils
of an actual degradation.</p>

<p>"At this moment&mdash;when we are about to form our highest
court, <i>entirely anew</i>, and <i>for a long period</i>&mdash;it is our
duty to give attention to the subject, to withdraw ourselves
for a little time from our private avocations in order to
fulfil our highest obligations as citizens of a republic.</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, special care ought to be exercised that our most
<i>wise</i>, <i>discreet</i>, and <i>disinterested</i> men be chosen to, and be
induced to attend, the nominating convention at Rochester
on the 27th.</p>

<p>"They should come there to confer for the public good,
in a spirit of <i>harmony</i>, conciliation, and surrender of all
personal prejudices and all personal antipathies to the great
object of forming <i>absolutely the best ticket possible</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, assuming&mdash;as we may, with confidence&mdash;that
we shall so act at the convention as to start our canvass with
the favorable opinion of the public and of the bar of the
State, still in a special election held at an unusual time,
and in so short a canvass, prompt and efficient measures
should be taken in each county to organize a movement to
bring out our vote and elect our ticket.</p>

<p>"I ask your co-operation for these objects.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>April 20, '70</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My letter, which passed yours in the
mails, if I recollect its contents aright, is, or implies a practical
answer to your last, so far as we can see until we meet
in Rochester. I have trusted to it for a day or two, while
I am engrossed with measures not capable of being deferred,
and which seem essential to the convention and election.</p>

<p>"As to candidates, I have carefully kept myself free;
saying uniformly&mdash;in quite a number of cases where communications
have been made to me personally or by letter&mdash;that
I intended to be perfectly and absolutely open when
opportunity should be had, at the convention and just before,
for consultation with our friends to do what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
seem best. I am not committed to Comstock, unless it
be implied that I would not decide against him until that
time, from such expressions made to him and to others.</p>

<p>"He, undoubtedly, has counted on the nomination as
chief judge; has believed that Allen was for him, and only
aimed to be associated with him.</p>

<p>"While I have kept more cautiously free than Kernan
and others, I wish to treat Comstock with delicacy and kindness.
Indeed, as I look upon my own future, totally void
of any conscious desire for the most honorable of official
labors, it seems to me I feel more difficulty in wounding&mdash;any
more than I at last must&mdash;those who are capable of fixing
strong affections on objects of an elevated ambition.</p>

<p>"I need not say how strong&mdash;and stronger than in other
cases&mdash;is the personal interest I feel in promoting what
shall be finally agreed to be best in respect to your future
career, or how disposed I should be to give the prevailing
weight to your own ideas on that subject.</p>

<p>"While it is not safe to assume the action of a convention,
I should think that besides those who will go for you
on public grounds and from personal regard, there will be
an element which would like to remove you from the field
of active politics. I thought, from December to very recently,
this was visible in respect to me, and perhaps there
may be even greater motive in respect to you in that you
were more likely to become a rival to some existing powers.</p>

<p>"Before I had quite finished my note, which lay over from
last evening, yours of yesterday came.</p>

<p>"You perhaps interpret it rather more strongly than I
intended. I aimed only to suggest the topic, and naturally
stated the <i>cons</i> rather than the <i>pros</i>.</p>

<p>"I will endeavor to see you, as you suggest, at Albion,
before the convention, unless something happens to make
this inadvisable.</p>

<p>"And letter-writing is so insufficient for such topics that
I reserve the discussion till then.</p>

<p>"Meantime, consider what is the method of proceeding
in nominating the <i>four</i>. Is that to be done singly, or on
one ballot?</p>

you are opposed to my taking a nomination for chief judge,
and it is quite likely you are right about it; but I feel that
there has been a great <i>break</i> in my life, and that it may be
as well to start on a new track. My reputation is now fair,
and on the bench I can keep it so, until I want to use it
for my own benefit and that of my friends, and I think I
can aid you politically as much as I can to remain as I am.
I shall, of course, object to being regarded as '<i>shelved</i>'

people will doubtless favor my nomination for that reason.
<i>They may be awfully mistaken, but this is confidential.</i></p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am obliged by the kind terms of your
note of yesterday, which were also repeated to me by Mr.
Frost, who called on me. But I do not change the feelings
with which I regard the nomination for the chief judge,
and have regarded it since it was presented to my view in
December, or weakened the settled preference I have for
freedom and relaxation over even such an honorable distinction.
Notwithstanding such a definitive purpose on my
part, I hope that you will take care to send a good delegate,
because you and I will probably never have another chance
of doing so much service to the community in which we
live, or to the profession to which we belong, as in securing
the best possible selection for judge of the judicial court
under a comparatively permanent tenure.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Apl. 22nd, '70</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I shall regret it extremely if you cannot
extricate yourself from the embarrassments which you
mention and I appreciate; and yet come to the convention,
if not as a delegate, at least as an outsider. Such an occasion
will not be likely to occur in your time or mine, and
ought we not seize it to do something of real value to our
four millions of people and to pay the debt which Lord
Coke says a lawyer owes to his profession?</p>

<p>"I have often thought and talked of you as eminently
suitable to take a part in the reconstructed court, but have
heard that you were not ready to sacrifice the large gains of
your professional career. You are over-modest in the suggestion
of one or two friends desiring you to come to a
different conclusion; for I have talked with a large number
who looked to you, and whose motives cannot be imputed
as mere friendship, but spring from a sense of public utility,
in securing to the public service your abilities and independent
integrity. Indeed, Grover told me some time ago
that he would not be a candidate if you would be; and I
think the same concession would have been generally made,
at least at an earlier day.</p>

<p>"With respect to myself, I cannot reconcile myself to the
idea of being tied up for a series of years. I prefer freedom
and a period of relaxation to any honors which involve
permanent and laborious duties. In December, and repeatedly
since, the suggestion from Albany has been made to me
that I might have a general support from that and this part
of the State for chief, in which those not supposed to be the
most friendly would concur, and a considerable number of
similar tenders have come to me from other quarters; but
to all, by letter and verbally, and among others to Cassidy,
each, and Allen&mdash;and to Comstock, who is an affirmatively
[<i>sic</i>] candidate, to Kernan and O'Conor&mdash;I have stated
my purpose, and I have no disposition to change it. It is
not that I undervalue these great trusts, but I am content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
that they go to those to whose more robust natures and
physical vigor the same considerations which influence me
are not applicable, and to those in whose peculiar condition
they are an object of laudable ambition. If I can help to
get a good selection, and then to elect the ticket, I shall
consider myself as concentrating in a few days all the public
service I could perform in the whole 14 years; and so
having completely acquitted myself to my day and generation,
become entitled to a play spell.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear sir, it is in just this matter that I regret
to lose your co-operation. <i>You</i>, if present as a delegate or
as an outsider, could help largely in the selection of members
from all parts of the state. For this city&mdash;if the bar
were to control as it now stands&mdash;they would unite on Rappallo,
but whether he can get any political support or not
remains to be seen. He has been one of Vanderbilt's counsel,
but I have often put him with you when I have said that,
with the best quality of men, that consideration could be
wholly disregarded.</p>

<p>"Can you extricate yourself from the embarrassments to
which you allude&mdash;or be neutral on that case&mdash;and come and
help as to others?</p>

<p>"Remember that for your time as well as mine this occasion
is not likely to recur.</p>

<p>"I sat down to say this, and must beg you to excuse me
for the long letter I have poured out upon you.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"Very Truly,</span><br />

<h3>TILDEN TO GEORGE W. CASS<br />

(JAY GOULD'S RETAINER)</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>June 2d, 1870</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will recollect that some time ago
I requested you to give me a statement in respect to the circumstances
attending an arrangement communicated to me
by you in the winter of 1869, by which the Erie Railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Company paid me a retainer of $10,000 in connection with
the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company, a majority
of the stock of which was then owned by the Erie Railway
Company. You deferred it, in consequence of the pressure
upon time. I should now like to have you furnish me the
statement.</p>

<p>"The reason I applied to you was that my original information
as to the purposes of this retainer was derived
exclusively from you; and that it was under this information,
in no respect changed by anything derived from other
sources, that I accepted the payment. The facts, so far as
they are within my knowledge, are these: Early in 1869&mdash;I
presume it must have been in January of that year&mdash;you
asked me to consent to become a director of the Cleveland
and Pittsburg Railroad Company and a member of the
executive committee of that company, holding the balance of
power between the other two members in case of their disagreement.
You stated the object to be to make an amiable
arrangement between the parties then litigating in an Ohio
court, whereby the railroad could be taken out of the possession
of the receiver and restored to the management of
the company; and that as a part of the same compromise
you were to become a director with others who were to be
agreed upon. You will remember that I replied that I was
already burdened with work in the capacity of director in
other companies, which consumed an inconvenient share of
my time and thought, and without remuneration; that the
tendency of such work was to become more encroaching;
that I had entered upon it in every instance only under the
influence of existing relations, and was desirous to relieve
myself of such duties as I had already done in some cases;
and that I was unwilling to take such a trust in respect to a
company in which I had no interest, and had never had any
relations. You and Mr. McCullough repeatedly pressed me
not to positively refuse; and when I was elected it was
without any assent on my part. One day you mentioned to
me that Mr. Jay Gould had proposed that the Erie should
pay me $10,000, the Cleveland and Pittsburg $5000, and
the Fort Wayne $5000. I certainly understood that those
payments were proposed to be made in respect to services or
benefits expected in connected with the arrangement for
the change in the condition and management of the Clev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>eland
and Pittsburg Company, and nothing else. Your communication
related to that matter and to that alone. You
will remember that when you mentioned the proposal to me
I made no comment, and manifested no interest in it or
desire that it should be adopted. Afterwards, when Mr.
Gould mentioned the matter to me he made no further or
different explanation, but spoke of it as if it were a matter
which I already completely understood. He subsequently,
a second time, mentioned that he was going to send me a
check, and about the last of February did send it. I never
did or said anything about the matter except to accept and
receipt for the check. The Cleveland and Pittsburg Company,
at a meeting when I was not present, but believe you
were, adopted a resolution appointing me their counsel,
with a monthly salary at the rate of $5000 a year. I had
supposed they would have put it in one payment, but they
adopted such form as they pleased. The Fort Wayne never
mentioned the subject to me, nor I to it. I had relations to
it, but none to the Cleveland and Pittsburg or to the Erie.
The proposition to make the payments by those two companies
was purely their own; the amounts were fixed without
any consultation with me, and on their own estimate of the
utility of the arrangement to them. In expressing to you
my repugnance to undertaking the services, I did not contemplate
any condition as to pecuniary compensation. Nor
can I now say that any such consideration was a principal
inducement to my aiding in the trust. I could not foresee
how much of labor or trouble I was to undertake. I did not
desire more business, but less. I had during the two years
before repeatedly declined retainers from the Erie and from
its adversaries. The object of the arrangement was attained.
The receivership was closed and the administration
of the road was restored to the Cleveland and Pittsburg
Company. I served out my term as director, as member
of the executive committee, and as counsel of the company,
and gave every necessary attention to those duties. When
this was done I deemed that I had performed all I had undertaken,
and that the C. and P. and the Erie had realized
all they had contemplated in the arrangement which they
had proposed, and in the payments which they had voluntarily
made.</p>

<p>"It was not until in February last, when I was acting for
the trustees of the bondholders of the Atlantic and Great
Western Railway Company, that I learned with surprise
that Mr. Gould entertained the idea that the implied engagement
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> accepting the retainer before mentioned extended
beyond the affair of the Cleveland and Pittsburg,
to which the arrangement exclusively related. I answered
him at the time. But the circumstance that he did entertain
such an idea induces me to address you this letter.</p>

<h3>EVILS OF OUR TIMES<br />

(ENDORSED "DRAFT OF CIRCULAR," ALL IN TILDEN'S SCRIPT)</h3>

<p>"<i>Centralism</i> in the <i>government</i>, and <i>corruption</i> in <i>administration</i>
are the twin evils of our times. They threaten
with swift destruction civil liberty and the whole fabric of
our free institutions.</p>


<h4>"<i>National Government.</i></h4>

<p>"The Democratic party was originally organized by Jeffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>rson
to oppose these evils. It ruled the country for fifty of
the seventy years of the present century, and protected us
from disunion on the one hand and from centralism on the
other, and from corruption. Under twelve years of rule of
the Republican party, the Federal government is rapidly
usurping power from the localities and from individuals,
and has become more corrupt than was ever imagined possible.
The masses of the Republicans, like the masses of
all parties, are honest. No doubt some allowance ought to
be made for the effect of a great war. But the system of
false finance which has corrupted us into a nation of gamblers
was as unnecessary as corrupting. And the principle
and measures of the Republican party, their centralism,
tariffs not for revenue but to control the labor and capital
of the people, legislative grants and jobs of all kinds tend
to corruption. And the ideal standard of their statesmen is
lower than any ever held by the followers of Jefferson and
Jackson.</p>


<h4>"<i>State Government.</i></h4>

<p>"In 1846, twenty-five years ago, I went to the Assembly
to sustain the administration of Silas Wright. Not a man in
either House was even suspected of corruption. The Democracy
under Martin Van Buren, Silas Wright, William
L. Marcy, and Azariah C. Flagg had ruled the State during
the life of the old Constitution from 1821 to 1846. They
were all men not only of transcendent ability, but of personal
purity. They gathered around them men of like character
in all the counties. They wielded party power not
only in favor of good measures, but in favor of good men.
No corrupt Senator or Assemblyman could live in their atmosphere.
The race ran out.</p>

<p>"From 1846 to 1870&mdash;23 years&mdash;the Democracy never
had a majority in the Senate, and but twice a small majority
in the Assembly. Those bodies became what the
Republicans, and the party from which they sprang, have
made them. When William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed
came into power the character of the legislative bodies fell
in an instant, and during all the 23 years of Republican
ascendancy it continued to fall."</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO W. CASSIDY</h3>

<p>
"<i>Confidential.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New Lebanon</span>, <i>Aug. 1871</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Cassidy</span>,&mdash;I think you had better note the
tone of the 30 or 40 extracts which the <i>Times</i> daily publishes
from journals of all parts of the United States&mdash;nearly
all administration, but a few Democratic. It indicates
the <i>mode</i> of using the exposures of the <i>Times</i> which
are employed throughout the country.</p>

<p>"Two ideas are sufficiently apparent now:</p>

<p>"1. That the evils and abuses in the local government of
the city of New York are general characteristics of the
Democratic party, and would occur in the Federal government
if that party should come into power at Washington.</p>

<p>"This argument, fallacious though it be, is likely to satisfy
the Republican mind and to animate it to effectiveness;
and to confuse and embarrass the Democratic mind, and
render it ineffective, if not irresolute. The immense preponderance
of the Republicans in journalism, and the situation
of this local cancer, directly under the focus of that
journalism, which makes it more conspicuous to the eye
of the country than a hundred such would be if existing
in remote or obscure parts&mdash;the peculiar and remarkable
clearness and certainty of the proofs compared with the inferential
and argumentative nature of the evidence in such
cases usually, are circumstances which go far to enable the
Republicans to succeed in propagating this idea. We are
out. Our case requires not merely firmness in holding our
position by our veterans, but affirmative, aggressive action,
resulting in accessions from the hostile or neutral, captures
from the enemy. If the higher <i>morale</i>&mdash;the better weapons,
the stronger ammunition&mdash;are not <i>with</i> us, but <i>against</i> us,
how are we to be capable of the kind of warfare necessary
to the situation?</p>

<p>"2. The second idea is that the leading Democratic journals
<i>defend</i> the wrongs alleged, thus impliedly adopting
them or admitting a responsibility for them, which does not
allow of disavowal and condemnation.</p>

<p>"A mode of discussion which countenances such a construction
is not only wrong but foolish, both in respect to the
party and the journal. All that can be conceded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> the
accused is the benefit of whatever doubts may exist as to
their guilt. It will not do to set off similar wrongs alleged
against the other party, for that, if frequently repeated,
will gradually foster in the public mind the conclusion that
we admit these wrongs to be properly carried to our side of
the account. The idea should be kept <i>all the while</i> before
the public mind that the Democratic party is not responsible
for these wrongs; that it will be foremost in punishing the
authors and foremost in adopting all measures necessary to
prevent their recurrence. The <i>first</i> impression is important,
and persistent repetitions of that impression are necessary
to affect the public mind. The point of the article
which was commended by Mr. Kernan, Gov. Beach, and
myself needs to be presented again and again&mdash;perhaps
with even more distinctness&mdash;until it attracts more public
attention than it seems to have done. This is especially
necessary in view of the articles in the <i>World</i>."</p>

the riot, and the ventilation of financial matters
in N. Y., are calculated to weaken our strength in the
country, and something must be done to counteract their

has been forced? It is so long since I have heard from

surgeons hack and cut away. There can be no
better time. When the public mind is turned to the question
of frauds, etc., etc., there will be a call for the books
at Washington as well as in the city of New York. I think
a spasm of virtue will run through the body politic. Business
is dull. The farmers are getting poor, with no look
ahead of better times. Immigration, railroads, and machinery
are crowding the markets with provisions and breadstuffs.
Taxes are now felt as they have not been since
1860. The corruption in our party is local. In the Republican
party it is pervading. We can lose nothing by
stirring up questions of frauds. I hope I shall meet you

exposures will not hurt us much in the country districts.
That is not my opinion. I should be sorry to think the demoralization
is so great that such things would not hurt us.</p>

the wrongdoers or whether we will separate from them and

at Westhampton, Long Island, and am sorry that I cannot
have a few minutes with you to talk about city affairs. It
seems to me that every honest man must be sincerely desirous
of a thorough investigation; for, independently of the
wrong to the taxpayers, it must be evident that popular
government cannot be maintained unless the authors and
sharers of the plunder, of which we have unquestionable evidence,
can be discovered and disgraced. I earnestly hope
that you, who stand before the community with as enviable
a reputation for integrity as any man in it, and who can do
so much to effect the object in view, will take an active part
in the movement which is in progress.</p>

<h3>S. J. TILDEN (CIRCULAR LETTER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE
DEMOCRATIC STATE COMMITTEE)</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Sept. 11, 1871</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The time between the meeting of the State
convention and the election being a little shorter than usual,
it has been deemed advisable to begin preparations for the
canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>s <i>at once</i>, so that even more than the ordinary period
for organization will be afforded. The poll-book for your
district has been already sent to the chairman of your
county committee, and may be had on application to him.</p>

<p>"The Democracy have never been called on to act when
<i>wisdom</i> and <i>courage</i>, and <i>devotion</i> to <i>principle</i> and to <i>right</i>
were more needed than at the State convention about to be
held.</p>

<p>"I appeal to you, therefore, to attend the primary meeting
which will choose delegates to your Assembly district
or county convention, and to send to that convention your
most discreet and best citizens, in order that they in turn
may choose as delegates to the State convention men <i>eminent</i>
for <i>judgment</i>, <i>integrity</i>, and <i>honor</i>, and who have, in the
largest degree, the trust and confidence of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>"<i>Centralism</i> in <i>government</i> and <i>corruption</i> in <i>administration</i>
are the twin evils of our times. They threaten with
swift destruction not only civil liberty, but the whole fabric
of our free institutions.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party was organized by Jefferson to oppose
these identical evils. It conducted the national government
for fifty of the seventy years of the present century,
and gave the people safety, prosperity, and happiness.</p>

<p>"The present demoralization has happened under the
ascendency of the Republican party; and though the mass
of them, like the mass of all parties, are honest in their intentions,
and some allowance ought to be made for the demoralizing
influence of a great civil war, more of these
results are to be ascribed to the utterly false and corrupting
system of finance unnecessarily adopted by these Republican
administrations; and there is no doubt the tendency
of the principles and measures of the Republican party is
unfavorable to purity in government.</p>

<p>"In the State, the Democracy ruled for twenty-five <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>years&mdash;from
1821 to 1846&mdash;under Van Buren, Wright, Marcy,
and Flagg; and corruption, always condemned and punished
by them, was almost unknown.</p>

<p>"In the 24 years from 1847 to 1870 the Democracy
never had a majority in the Senate. Twice only did it have
a slender majority in the Assembly.</p>

<p>"The Republicans had the legislative power of the State,
and that is now the government both at Washington and at
Albany.</p>

<p>"The Republicans made the morals of the legislative
bodies what they have recently been. When Seward and
Weed took the place of Wright, Marcy, and Flagg, public
and official morality fell in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>"Even as to the city government of New York, until
1870, it was exactly what the Republican legislatures made
it. The Republican party was born in 1855. In 1856 it
swept the State by 80,000. In the Senate of 1857 the
Democrats had but 4 out of 32 members; in the Assembly,
but 37 out of 128.</p>

<p>"Then the Republicans made the city charter under
which we have lived until 1870. At the same session the
same hand which created the Republican party created also
the supervisor's board, which has been the source of all the
corruptions in our city government.</p>

<p>"The league between corrupt Republicans and corrupt
Democrats which was formed during Republican ascendency
was too strong for honest men in 1870. The charter of that
year had the votes of nearly all the Republicans. I denounced
it in a public speech.</p>

<p>"Wherever the gangrene of corruption has reached the
Democratic party we must take a knife and cut it out by
the roots.</p>

<h3>W. F. HAVEMEYER TO R. B. CONNOLLY</h3>

<p>

<br />
"<span class="smcap">Richard B. Connolly, Esq.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have considered the question which you have
submitted to me; and, to prevent the possibility of misapprehension,
reduce my advice to writing.</p>

<p>"1. On the assumption of your innocence of the charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
made against you, I do not consider resignation of your
office as your proper course. Your duty is to give every
facility to the fullest investigation, and to abide the result.</p>

<p>"2. In your answer to the request of Mayor Hall for your
resignation, you have stated that your official acts which
have been impeached were 'supervised and approved by the
superior vigilance' of Mayor Hall; that equal responsibility
for them attaches to him, and that, in his affidavits in the
pending litigation, those acts were adopted and vindicated
by him.</p>

<p>"Even if you are conscious of having done wrong in your
trust, you owe it to the community not to commit another
wrong, but to make every reparation within your
power.</p>

<p>"To surrender your office into the hands of a confederate
would be a fresh betrayal of your trust; and, while it might
damage yourself, would fail of doing justice to the community.
You practically make your own successor. As the
law now stands, he can assume your office only by an arrangement
to which you are a party to create a vacancy for
him. The man you give place to ought not to be the tool of
those implicated in the transactions which excite the public
distrust and alarm. He should be the nominee of the
citizens now seeking to protect the people. In that way
alone can he have the confidence of the public, or sustain
the credit of the city.</p>

<p>"No man selected by Mayor Hall can, without some other
moral support from the community, have the public confidence.
He will be compromised by a previous understanding
with the Rodin of the 'ring' or by the acceptance of the
favor.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the law affords a perfect solution of the
case. By sec. 3, chap. 574 of the laws of 1871, you are
authorized to appoint a deputy comptroller who, in addition
to his other powers, possesses every power and shall perform
every duty belonging to the office of comptroller whenever
the said comptroller shall by due written authority,
and during a period to be specified in such authority, 'designate
and authorize the said deputy comptroller to possess
the power and perform the duty aforesaid.'</p>

<p>"My advice to you is to forthwith appoint Andrew H.
Green as such deputy comptroller; to leave him to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the full powers of your office without conditions and without
interference; with complete custody of all books and
papers belonging to your office; with the appointment of all
persons whom he may think necessary to protect the public
property and interests, and to enable him to carry out the
most searching investigations, and to aid the committees
appointed for that purpose.</p>

<p>"I have carefully considered the selection I recommend.
Mr. Green has knowledge and experience in the affairs of
the city; has the most reliable character for integrity; has
no relations which could mislead him by bad influences, and
is strong in the public confidence. If you adopt my advice
I shall insist on his accepting the disagreeable duty for the
sake of the public interest."</p>

questions which he has submitted to me, I have deemed
it best to adopt the shortest and most direct way to get at
the condition of affairs in the comptroller's office and of the
city government, in order that the public may have the earliest
information relating [thereto]. To this end, I have advised
the comptroller to appoint you his deputy, and to commit
to you all the powers of his office without conditions or
restrictions. This he has consented to do, and I enclose his
appointment without conditions. I have no doubt that this
position in the present condition of affairs will be most distasteful
to you, but I deem it your duty promptly to accept
its duties, and to do what you can to aid in restoring order

him not to resign, but as the best thing that can be
done, under the circumstances, to appoint a deputy in whom
the public has confidence. Of course you cannot accept the

elevate them above all suspicion of unfair or interested motive.
I am endeavoring to act with sincere regard to the

pursuing the authority and phraseology of the statute I hereby
designate and authorize you to possess the power and
perform all and every duty belonging to the office of comptroller

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have given the best attention in my
power to the matters mentioned yesterday.</p>

<p>"1. My mind is fully and conclusively made up as to the
convention. I will not attend it for this single reason. The
post of duty on these occasions is <i>that</i> in which one can be
most useful. In my opinion this little use of my nativity
is the proper <i>venue</i> for my action. Appoint me, if you like,
give me a respectable alternate, and I will write <i>him</i> a letter.</p>

<p>"2. I think it would be very inexpedient to take Mr.
Green out of the city for 24 hours. He ought <i>not</i> to go to
Rochester.</p>

<p>"3. I have little knowledge of Connolly, and no access
to him, nor would I be willing to have any. Consider:</p>

<p>"1. Must you not in resolutions, etc., body forth the determination
to compel robbers to disgorge and even to inflict
punishment, etc.?</p>

<p>"2. Will 'Slippery Dick' stick to his integrity steadily
for weeks, in the face of a hazard like this?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>"Therefore,</p>

<p>"3. Is it not desirable to strike whilst the iron is hot,
get a resignation and the appointment of 'Handy Andy,'
as I perceive the slow wits of the opposition begin to call
him? It is not a bad name, and might do a man good who
sought preferment, if he could get it to stick. Handy Andy
blundered, to be sure, but he was faithful and honest in the
last degree, and his blunders were true Irish bulls; they
excited merriment, thus doing good to the souls and bodies
of the observers; a certain <i>na&iuml;ve</i> wit hung around each erroneous
conception that evinced a good motive; besides, there
was in each a singular approximation to cleverness and a
kind Providence always effectively gainsaid any actual evil
in the results.</p>

<h3>HORATIO SEYMOUR TO TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Utica</span>, <i>October 8, 1871</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have not been well since I got back
from Rochester, but I have turned over the state of things in
my mind, and I now sit down to give you the ends I have
reached. When I left home I thought our friends had made
up their minds to take high ground. When I met Lord and
others at your room I saw at once 'the switch had been
changed.' When Lord asked about the ticket I knew that a
party had been made up to which you and Kernan and
myself were not to be invited. Of that I am proud. All
of the officeholders, the canal contractors, etc., are in it.
Warren, DeWolf, and Cassidy lead the move. It is not in
my heart to say an unkind word of Cassidy. In many ways
he has had a hard time. His fine mind has been used by
others while he was left poor. It was the strange policy of
the Central Railroad men to give wealth to Weed and others,
who fought them if they did not, while Cassidy was helped
to live by loans and in other ways which kept him poor.
When Tweed went to Albany he turned a stream of patronage
into the <i>Argus</i> office which made it strong and rich. I
think Cassidy means, in the main, to stand up for the right,
but it is hard for him to strike men who have lifted hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>m into
wealth and when all about him shrink back. Now what
are we to do? A new party is made up, and we are outside
of it. For this I am glad. But this is not all. We may
forgive others, but the men who have left us will not forgive
us. The old ties are broken. They have yielded to
temptation, and now they are like church members who
have fallen from grace; they not only hate to meet their
minister, but they learn to hate him. This feeling cropped
out at Rochester. They were glad to hit us, and the young
men would have done more if the wiser ones had not held
them back. You would have been put off the State committee
and McQuade would have had the seat of Kernan
if they had thought it wise. All things were made ready
to do both of these acts. While Kernan was thrown off of
his guard by Van Buren's assurances that his seat would
not be contested, the committee on credentials was made up;
their names were known to McQuade's friends, and an active
canvass was made in his behalf. The plan was either
to reject Kernan or to keep him out until the Tammany men
were made sure that their seats would not be filled. I
made up my mind to go home. I told Mr. Warren I would
not act as president of the convention. In the evening I
was very ill, and when the committee called upon me I said
I was not well enough to go into convention. This was true,
but I am sorry I put that reason out. I was in so much
pain that I had not my wits about me. I should have said
to them, as I did to Warren, simply that I would not preside.</p>

<p>"Now what are we to do? You know that I hold that
all that a man does about politics after he is sixty years
old is only meddling with other people's business. But
duty may force us to act, and then how do we stand? The
Democratic leaders and organization are dead against us.
The members of the convention went home pleased with the
diplomacy of their leaders, but with lower tone of morality
than they had when they left home. The young men we
looked to with hope in the future are debauched. They
were willing to have Tammany coaxed out of the convention
and then to slam the door in the face of the honest men
who had unearthed crime in New York. When the leaders
had done their work on Thursday noon the Tammany men
stood in the light of having acted in a high-toned, generous
way. The convention was grateful to them for allowing
it to say stealing was wrong in a way that should hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> no
one's feelings. The anti-Tammany men were in disgrace
and disfavor. The majority of convention wanted to leave
matters in that shape, and they were angry when you and
Kernan and West and others forced them to do a few decent
acts. I think you saved the ticket by this. I know you
saved your honor. You must now count upon the hostility
of old supporters and of all State officials. You are in the
way. If you mean to fight you can do so by means of the
new parties in New York. You must hold them up to the
highest tone and to untiring activity. You must put yourself
at the head of the reformers and use your list of correspondents
for any papers you wish to send out to enlist
the country against frauds. I have stated all the odds
against you, but you can whip the party back to right
grounds if you wish to do so. It is on the defensive now.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;No single incident of the war against the
machine has given the people everywhere so much joy as
the announcement yesterday by telegraph that Charles
O'Conor had been tendered an Assembly nomination and
had not declined, but justified the hope of his acceptance.
The acceptance and election to the Assembly of O'Conor
would, in my judgment, aside from what he might be able
to accomplish by official action, be productive of a good
moral effect that is incalculable. He occupies a position to-day
prouder than that of any President or crowned head.
Universally recognized as the foremost man of the bar, and
unreservedly trusted as a guardian of the people's rights
and interests in a time of great peril, all eyes are turned
towards him as a sort of savior in this era of corruption in
governmental administration. His declination now, after
giving ground for hope, would be disheartening. I earnestly
trust that the pressure will be brought to bear upon him so
strongly that he will not disappoint the people.</p>

<p>"You yourself ought by all means to go to the Assembly
also. While your position differs in some respects from that
of Mr. O'Conor, your presence at Albany this winter would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
be no less important. You have led, are the leaders of, the
fight against the machine, and, of course, have incurred the
hostility and hatred of the machine men and their henchmen
in different parts of the State. The fight will be continued
in various forms at Albany during the session of the
Legislature, and you ought to be there to direct it, as well
as to do service on the floor of the Assembly. Our Democratic
press, that is heartily in the good work, must speak out
fully and boldly of all proceedings this winter, and not leave
iniquity to be cloaked and public sentiment to be formed
by subsidized newspapers and newspaper correspondents at
Albany. I have never given Albany matters during the
session much attention heretofore, but next winter it will
not be my fault if the public of western New York do not
learn through the <i>Union</i> what is going on, and all that is
going on.</p>

over and the political labor, I presume, at an end, I venture
to approach you with a request to which I earnestly hope you
will find yourself able to accede.</p>

<p>"You are probably aware that the <i>North American Review</i>
has taken occasion, from time to time, to follow up the
history of the great scandals which have made New York
so unpleasantly famous, especially the Erie troubles. I am
desirous of placing on record, by the side of the 'Chapter
of Erie,' an account of the Tammany frauds and their history,
given by a person whose authority is decisive. In view
of the further questions relating to New York government,
likely to come up before your legislature and in the press,
it seems probable that a clear and a non-partisan (that is,
not Republican) statement of the case may be of political
value as well as of historical interest.</p>

<p>"An account, therefore, of the Tammany frauds and their
occasion, of the struggle of Tammany to maintain itself
after the discovery, and of the means by which it was overthrown,
and, finally, an expression of opinion as to the
proper means of preventing such evils in the future, seems
to me to be required.</p>

<p>"I know of no one except yourself who is capable of doing
this properly. You alone know the private history of
the affair, and have the means of estimating the actors at
their proper value. I venture, therefore, to ask you to do
it. If, as I believe, this story is to become historical, I am
anxious that historians should be rightly informed as to the
facts.</p>

<p>"In case there is any chance of your undertaking the task,
I shall hope to hear from you shortly.</p>

Wednesday, January 3rd, and take testimony in relation to
the abuses alleged to exist in the Custom House in that city.</p>

<p>"Mr. Casserly and I are desirous the investigation should
not be fruitless or superficial. To prevent its being either
we must rely on the friends of honest government and reform
in <i>both</i> political parties to place us on the track of
these abuses that we may unkennel them.</p>

<p>"If the utterances of the <i>Tribune</i>, the <i>Evening Post</i>, the
<i>Sun</i> and other organs are meant in earnest, they must now
prove it by admitting us to their sources of information.
If they rely upon their party friends in the committee, then,
I fear, <i>our</i> hopes in the question will be blighted.</p>

<p>"I write you, knowing the grand service you have done
and are doing, and because I believe your position and relation
to the <i>honest</i> Republican leaders in the desired reforms
will give you influence with them.</p>

if possible, to stay here until the 26th inst. This will afford
an opportunity to put some matters in shape for the operations
required after Jany. 1.</p>

<p>"There will be such a pressure of the <i>outs</i> to get <i>in</i>, and
of the jobbers to stick a project here and a plan there that
no reform charter can possibly be framed and accepted on
Gov. Church's instantaneous plan.</p>

<p>"A few very brief enactments can be framed which will
meet every public necessity, and thro' a commission a really
good charter may be framed. The lean corruptionists, who
see a prospect of pasture, will, of course, try to control the
appointment and the action of the commission, but the faces
which have been set like flint against the <i>fat</i> sharpers must
also present a stern front to the lean. If the Legislature is
to fail in its duty, perhaps so much the better. What his
lazy Majesty the People has long needed was a sharp prick
of the corruptionist's spear. It may be that he is not yet
sufficiently aroused. Fainting in the legislature may be
an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>"The <i>present</i> pressing needs of legislation can easily be
supplied. The muddle about the Aldermen is as easily disposed
of as the Mayor, Tweed, and Fields. Luckily, the law
point is manifestly against the recently elected Republican
Aldermen. We can show how to <i>give</i> them their seats.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">"<span class="smcap">13 West 42d St., Sunday, A.M.</span> (<i>1872</i>).</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It was remarked in my hearing last
evening, after you had so gratified the club and its guests,
'Mr. Tilden looks as if he not only had a great head, but
also a large heart.' I propose to address the latter, if you
will graciously pardon the intrusion.</p>

<p>"I learn that Mr. Peckham intends procuring from the
Oyer and Terminer G. J. a duplicate charge agst. me for
official neglect. It is in your <i>power</i> to advise against and
prevent this. I think, sir, I can satisfy you that such advice
will be in harmony with that unflinching standard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
justice by which you measure all men and all things.</p>

<p>"I have filed an unqualified stipulation that pending
charges be removed to the O. and T. The removal order
has been entered. This would have been done before except
that Mr. Vanderpool expected Judge Bedford to sit and
make it <i>pro forma</i>. There is, therefore, no legal necessity
for a duplicate. To press one now is only to wound the
feelings of my very interesting family by arousing fresh
(and doubtless, at this partisan pitch, cruel) newspaper
criticism, and without accomplishing any better oblation to
justice (either to me or the people, as the case may prove)
than could be attained with existing pleading. And especially
when some weeks ago I wrote Atty.-Genl. Barlow I
should always be ready for his convenience.</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that ever since, in Sept., 1871, I became
convinced of the monstrous frauds (committed by men
whose offences are condoned, or whose battles are carried on
over my shoulders, because I neither skulk nor avoid fight)
I have done much to atone for any imputed neglect in my
acts as an auditor during the month of terrible mental trial
to me which followed the inauguration of the new charter
(May to June, 1870), as well as to entitle me to consideration
upon a mere question of discretion like this I now ask
you to prefer to Mr. Peckham. I say discretion, because,
were it a question in his mind of imperative right towards
his affirmative action, I could not insult you, nor him, nor
myself by the request to forego it. I shall always be willing
to meet the <i>necessary</i> exactions of the law without asking
favor. It is only against unnecessary applications I
respectfully protest. Surely my unassailed administration
as Dist. Atty. during <i>12</i> years; my bearing and course as
Mayor in all save these unfortunate audits or non-audits
(as you please to phrase it); the character of my appointments
since Nov., 1871; my uniform support of Mr. Green
in his trying position; and my surrender of much personal
pride to aid even personal enemies in accomplishing public
good, ought to entitle me to ask from Mr. Peckham to be
spared all unnecessary stigmas.</p>

<p>"Pray pardon <i>me</i> for thus annoying you who, at this
crisis, must be almost overwhelmed with duties. But when
I heard the remark with which I began this note, the suggestion
came to me with almost the intuition of a woman,
and as if the whisper of a daughter&mdash;'appeal to his heart.'</p>

<h3>TILDEN TO GEO. W. CASS</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was compelled by what seemed for
the time to be the most urgent of my many duties, to remain
in Albany a little after the diligent chairman of the
judiciary committee had resumed the investigations held in
this city. In that interval, Mr. George Ticknor Curtis
thought it pertinent to the defence of Judge Barnard to
introduce certain statements concerning me from Mr. Jay
Gould. It happened, also, that the examination on this
topic was conducted with so little art&mdash;or with so much
art&mdash;that it totally failed to elicit the complete or substantial
truth, and did produce, in practical effect, a mere falsehood.
It happened further that, although the investigation
is not public, the testimony on this point appears in this
morning's journals, with an exceptional fulness.</p>

<p>"If I had been present, I presume Mr. Gould's testimony
could have been developed so as to render any further
statement to establish the exact truth unnecessary. But as
it was not, the series of accidents&mdash;such I will assume them
to be&mdash;that have falsified the transaction, will excuse me in
asking you to state the truth which is peculiarly within
your personal knowledge.</p>

<p>"The <i>Herald</i> report is as follows:</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> Did you employ any other counsel beside Messrs.
Field and Shearman, in behalf of the Erie Railroad?'</p>

<p>"'<i>A.</i> I employed several others.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> Who were they?'</p>

<p>"'<i>A.</i> I had John Ganson, of Buffalo; Judge Diven, of
Elmira; and Samuel J. Tilden, of New York.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> When did you retain Samuel J. Tilden?'</p>

<p>"'<i>A.</i> In the year 1869.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> Did you retain him before this order was granted?'</p>

<p>"'<i>A.</i> Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> How much did you pay Mr. Tilden?'</p>

<p>"'<i>A.</i> Ten thousand dollars.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Q.</i> Did Mr. Tilden ever do anything for that ten
thousand dollars?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>"'<i>A.</i> No, sir; on the contrary, I heard nothing about
Mr. Tilden until he turned up as counsel against the Erie
Railroad in a case with the Atlantic and Great Western
Railroad.'</p>

<p>"The <i>Times</i> report varies a little:</p>

<p>"'Q. Did he ever act as your counsel?'</p>

<p>"'A. Never to my knowledge, nor did he ever return the
retaining fee.'</p>

<p>"Now, it is within your personal knowledge that the fee
paid me was for a year's service as counsel and arbiter in
the executive committee of the Cleveland and Pittsburg
Railroad Company. The arrangement was formed by you
without my presence or knowledge; and the only communication
of the terms of it ever made to me was by you.</p>

<p>"In January, 1869, the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad
was placed in the possession of a receiver by an Ohio
court, on the ground of fraud and breach of trust, committed
or intended, by the then board of directors. Mr.
Gould disavowed the acts complained of, and desired to have
the road restored to the management of a board of directors
to be newly constituted. You stated to me that the only
feasible arrangement for a compromise between the parties
was this: The executive committee was to be composed
of myself, Mr. J. N. McCullough, the president, and Mr.
Gould, who represented a majority of the stock then alleged
to be held by the Erie Railway Company. I, who had no
interest with either party, and was indifferent between them,
was to hold the balance of power between the two other members,
and be able to decide every question of law and every
question of administration in respect to which they should
differ. When the arrangement was submitted to me I declined
the part allotted to me. I said I had no interest in
the company, and never had any relation to it which imposed
a duty in respect to it upon me. I declined more
than once to you and Mr. McCullough, notwithstanding
the arrangement had been made by which the Erie was to
contribute $10,000 and the C. and P. $5000 as compensation.
I thought the trust might be troublesome and vexatious;
and, at any rate, did not want the business. You,
nevertheless, appointed me; and I afterwards acquiesced.
I at no time made any conditions about compensatio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>n. I
never rendered a bill. The payments, when they were made,
were purely voluntary. I presume you do not doubt that
nothing but your personal persuasions and those of Mr.
McCullough induced me finally to acquiesce.</p>

<p>"You never communicated to me that there was any idea
on anybody's part that I should owe any duty to the Erie
Railway Company except to perform my duties as counsel,
director, and arbiter in the executive committee of the
Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company. I never assumed
<i>any other obligation</i>.</p>

<p>"That duty I performed during the whole year. Upon
every question of law, of administration, of policy, I acted;
and, as far as I know, with satisfaction to everybody. I had
no difficulty with Mr. Gould, who always behaved with consideration
and deference. He got the company out of its
troubles, and largely enhanced the market value of the
stock by the arrangement, and appeared to be satisfied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gould may well say that (except so far as acting
in the Cleveland and Pittsburg was acting for the Erie)
I never did act for the Erie in anything, so far as he
knew. I never undertook to do so. There never was any
ground to pretend that in any of the litigations of that company
it had any claim to aid, or shelter, or countenance
from me.</p>

<p>"As to the Atlantic and Great Western, I never acted
for the company. Prior to this time I had acted for Mr.
A. C. Flagg and others, trustees under several of the mortgages,
and for certain bondholders; and Mr. Gould knew
it. Certainly, nothing in this engagement in the Cleveland
and Pittsburg interfered with my right to continue to act
for those trustees and creditors, or to act anew for them.
In January and February, 1870, I argued before the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania and in the Ohio court, for
the trustees and first mortgage bondholders, various questions
as to the proposed lease. Mr. Gould faintly set up a
claim that he was entitled to notice from me; and I at once
reminded him that he knew all the time what my relations
to the trustees and bondholders were, and had been for years,
and that I had frequently, as <i>their</i> representative, had conferences
with the counsel of the Erie. The union of the
Atlantic and Great Western Company and the creditors
inferior to the first mortgage with the Erie, prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>ed; and
a lease&mdash;which I believe all now agree was improvident and
unwise&mdash;was made.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to say that it might not happen that a
retainer is sometimes received and yet no further services
rendered in the case. I presume that this often happens
without impropriety. I have only to say that, so far as I
recollect, it never has happened to me in any single instance
of my professional life. I have been content to receive
compensation fixed by agreement with my clients after the
services were rendered. I have, in no instance, had any
controversy or difference of opinion with any client as to
the amount of compensation. I have never heard of any
discontent after the settlement, unless this may be such a
case.</p>

<p>"Since there is an elaborate attempt to misrepresent an
act of my professional life, I have a right to say this&mdash;without
the imputation of egotism; and I have a right to
add that, for the last sixteen years, at least, my only trouble
has been not to accept more business than I could perform
according to my standard of duty and justice to those who
entrust their affairs to my management; that I have not
accepted half which has been offered of cases in which the
clients were willing themselves to fix my compensation to
my full satisfaction out of what they would recognize as
acknowledged benefits.</p>

<p>"And I have never hesitated to choose what business I
would decline. At the outset of the famous litigation of
the Erie, under the presidency of Mr. Eldridge, it was
communicated to me that the Erie desired to retain me;
and afterwards Mr. J. C. Bancroft Davis, in its behalf,
twice came to my office to offer me retainers. I declined.
In 1869, Mr. James McHenry, when acting in apparent
unison with the Erie, several times pressed upon me retainers
in behalf of his scheme of reorganization of the
A. &amp; G. W.; but, after considering his scheme, I declined.
In the same year Mr. James Fisk, Jr., called upon me with
Mr. Jay Gould. Mr. Fisk said, with many flattering suggestions,
that they desired to retain me in reference to a
matter then pending, and in the course of the interview he
stated that they had paid within a year $125,000 to a member
of the bar, whose name he mentioned. I declined.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to imply that there would have been
anything wrong in acting as counsel for the Erie in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> a proper
case; but simply, when an act of mine is challenged, to
state facts which are pertinent to my vindication. I have
ever stood, not only in my personal conduct, but in my public
influence, for the dignity and honor of the bar and the
purity of the bench, and against whatever should tend to
weaken or degrade the administration of justice. I did so,
in 1869, when the evils of corrupt times were growing and
powerful. I accepted issue in the Democratic State convention
of that year. On the 1st of February, 1870, at the
meeting which resulted in the formation of the Bar Association,
I uttered these unpremeditated thoughts:</p>

<p>"'If the bar is to become merely a method of making
money, making it in the most convenient way possible, <i>but
making it</i> <span class="smcap">AT ALL HAZARDS</span>, then the bar is <i>degraded</i>. If the

lowest point in the great cycle which we have occasionally

better public sentiment, in which speculation and gambling

which free government will vindicate its rights to the confidence
of mankind. If I did not believe this, I should

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>March 18, 1872</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have this morning received your
letter of Saturday, and hasten to answer it, as I am to leave
this city for Pittsburg this afternoon.</p>

<p>"Your statement of the facts connected with the arrangement
to pay you a counsel fee of $10,000 by the Erie Railro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>ad
Company, for services in the Cleveland and Pittsburg
Railroad, is strictly correct, all of which came within
my personal knowledge.</p>

<p>"At the time, since, and now, I held and hold the position
of president of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway
Company, which company then held, and still holds,
a very important contract relation with the Cleveland and
Pittsburg Railroad Company. It was this fact that caused
me to take an interest in the complication in which the
Cleveland and Pittsburg Company was involved in 1869,
and which had been brought about through the action of a
director of the Erie Company, that company at the time
(as was believed) holding a majority of the stock of the
Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company.</p>

<p>"To free the latter company from the litigation in which
it was involved, I came to this city and had an interview
with the then president of the Erie Railway Company, who
condemned the whole proceedings of what was called the
'Erie board' at Cleveland. He agreed that a portion of
the members should resign, and that you and myself should
come into the direction and the executive committee. I returned
home, and, after a conference with J. N. McCullough,
Esq., then and now president of the C. &amp; P. R. Co.,
a plan of reorganization was agreed upon, as set forth in
your letter. To this date nothing had been said to you on
the subject. On coming to this city, and developing the
plan to you, you declined to go into the board or have anything
to do with the business, for the reasons stated in your
letter. I said to Mr. Gould and Mr. McCullough&mdash;the latter
more than once&mdash;not to urge the question on you any
further, as you might take such a decided stand that we
would not be able to overcome your objections, but that the
plan should be proceeded with, and we should elect you into
the board and take the chances of getting you to serve. This
was done, and you were elected without consulting you
farther or obtaining your consent. After the reorganization
of the board the arrangement that you should be the umpire
in the executive committee, and have charge of all legal
proceedings and be general counsel to the committee and
board was arranged as you state, and without first consulting
you. I took it upon myself to make such arrangements
as would bring harmony into the board, believing you would
acquiesce in such arrangement as I might make. Befor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>e
you came into the Cleveland and Pittsburg board a resolution
was placed on the minutes electing you the general
counsel, and fixing the compensation. It was also proposed
that owing to the interest which the Erie Railway Company
had (controlling a majority of the stock), and the interest
which the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway
Company had by its contract with the Cleveland and Pittsburg
Railroad Company, that each of those companies
should retain you in their respective behalfs touching those
interests. All this was done without any indication from
you as to what you would do.</p>

<p>"I afterwards learned from you that the Erie Railway
Company had paid you the ten thousand dollars, as agreed,
without waiting for you to render a bill. The five thousand
dollars agreed to be paid by the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and
Chicago Railway Company has never been paid or even
spoken of since.</p>

<p>"The compensation above referred to was for those specific
services and for no other, so far as I ever heard or believe.
Those services continued to the close of the year,
when you retired from the board. I remained in the board
during that year and ever since.</p>

<p>"I will add that the arrangement made in 1869 was of
large pecuniary benefit to the stockholders, and gave to the
affairs, as well as the stock of the company, a stability they
had never before had.</p>

<p>"I believe what I have written covers the whole case&mdash;at
least I have so intended&mdash;and if, after I return from
Pittsburg, it shall be found that any facts have been omitted,
I shall be glad to supply the deficiency.</p>

I have had enough of horses which lose in whole or in part

appearance, temper, and action. The color is of less importance.</p>

to bring on the horse 'Morris Miller' at my expense and risk,
and the other horse at your own expense and risk, I will
take 'Morris Miller' at $5000; and if the other horse shall
prove satisfactory to Mingo and me on an opportunity of
trial for a week or two, to be determined with reference to
the weather and my being in town, I will give $5000 more
and the pony for the other horse.</p>

<p>"Of course, I do not want to try one horse alone, and in
doing so rely upon your representation that the other horse
will suit, and that the two will work together as you say.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;For some years past I have not been
able to see how I could do any good by active political
action. This year it looked as though something might be
accomplished, and I signified my willingness to go to the
State convention, and allowed myself to become interested
in the political situation. The nominations at Cincinnati
gave me a recoil, but still I hoped something might be done.
I confess I am almost discouraged again. If Greeley is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> to
be nominated at Baltimore it will so divide the Democrats
as to cause defeat just when success is within our reach by
a judicious nomination, either wholly Democratic or partly
and principally liberal Republican. We could unite on
Trumbull, Adams, Davis, Cox, etc. I could even (though
reluctantly) support Chas. Sumner, but I don't see how I
can preserve my self-respect if I vote for Greeley.</p>

<p>"Is his nomination at Baltimore a necessity? If a
straight Democratic ticket is not advisable, why could not
some arrangement be made to nominate, say, Trumbull, and
some reform Democrat, yourself, for instance, for V. P.?
I am not so much a 'Bourbon' but that I could vote for
such a ticket with great pleasure. I care nothing for the
issues which are past, but Mr. Greeley is directly against
us upon the great living issues, those issues which began
with our govt. and must last as long as it lasts. He has
not, besides, the qualities which fit for the Presidency, but
others which would make him the prey of the designing and
corrupt.</p>

<h3>TILDEN'S ADDRESS TO THE BAR ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">"(<i>Circa 1872.</i>)</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I congratulate you on the substantial
progress which has been made in purifying the judiciary.
Everything which at the beginning of the late legislative
session you set before yourselves as practicable, everything
which you were afterwards encouraged to undertake, has
been accomplished. You asked for an inquiry into abuses
in the administration of justice. You have had an investigation&mdash;patient
and thorough&mdash;during seven weeks, in session
continued from ten in the morning until late at night&mdash;carried
on in the presence of the accused and their counsel.
It is true the inquiry could only touch a small part of the
evil&mdash;the specific cases presented by you. But every judge
against whom you made charges has been put on his trial,
except one, who fled from the ordeal. I repeat to you to-n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>ight
what I said at the meeting at which this association
was organized. It was on Feb. 1, 1879&mdash;when the shameful
perversion of judicial process and judicial power
that characterized 1869 were fresh in the public mind, and
the corrupt oligarchy, whose tools these judges were, seemed
to sit enthroned over the prostrate people of our metropolis.</p>

<p>"If it will do its duty to itself, the bar can do everything
else. It can have reformed constitutions, it can have a reformed
judiciary. It can have the administration of justice
made pure and honorable. One word as to the pending impeachment
of Judge Barnard. I do not share the fears
which have been expressed in the public journals as to the
results. First, I know that in the investigation, which extended
to all the witnesses the accused desired to produce,
and with full cross-examinations, there was developed more
impeachable matter&mdash;ten times over&mdash;than can be found in
the eight principal cases of judicial impeachment, four resulting
in convictions which have occurred in this country.
Secondly, I believe that the leading members of the committee
of managers will faithfully prosecute the trial.
Thirdly, I have the most absolute confidence in the abilities,
professional skill, and earnest patriotism of the counsel who
will represent the people, and on whom the real burden of
the trial will fall. I respect the sentiments of my brethren
of the bar which demanded that I should continue still
farther my connection with the movement to purify the
judiciary. I mean, of course, as one of the managers of the
impeachment, for you all know that I would not have acted
as counsel. While I did not feel at liberty by my own act
to withhold any service which you thought I could render
to the great reform, my opinion differs somewhat from the
public impression. The great work of investigation, of collecting
evidence, and of securing sufficient concurrence and
co-operation to put the accused on trial&mdash;which has been an
immense and difficult labor&mdash;is done. The gentlemen whom
I met in conference, after everything had been completed
except to decide on the form of procedure&mdash;when I consented
to impeachment instead of removal by concurrent
resolution&mdash;and I see several of those gentlemen present,
will remember that I then stated my difficulty in engaging
in a prolonged trial during the summer. When the choice
of the managers came to be made I did not feel called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> on to
enter into a canvass or to form combinations. In everything
else I had felt it my duty to exercise all foresight
and every care, and to exert every power I possess to organize
such elements as could be found for good ends. In this
I felt entitled to leave every human being to his spontaneous
action. If I should receive an honorable discharge I
had a right to accept it. I cannot be accused of selfishness
if I did so with delight. One care only remained for
me. That was to look after the choice of counsel. I communicated
what seemed to be, in the actual circumstances,
the best suggestions to Mr. Alvord, and met his prompt and
cordial concurrence. Of Mr. Van Cott&mdash;the senior member
of the committee which represented you in the investigation&mdash;I
need not speak. The eminent jurist with whom
he will be associated&mdash;Judge Comstock&mdash;will bring to his
duty great abilities, ample stores of learning, and an honorable
pride in restoring the renown of the bench and the
bar of this State. I remember with what solemn earnestness
he said to me several years ago that we could never
reform the judiciary of this district until we had first
crushed the corrupt power which stood behind it. I do not
see that justice will be more likely to fail that the trial is
to be conducted in the light of open day, with the eager
scrutiny of the bar of the State and country, and under
the eyes of a watchful, apprehensive, and somewhat distrusting
people. While what has been done towards purifying
the judiciary is just cause of congratulation, you will
appreciate the difficulties through which it has been obtained
if you reflect that everything else in the way of reform
has failed. It is known to you that when I consented
to go to the Assembly it was with a view to the judicial
reform and to certain other measures more particularly interesting
to the people of this city, and that in that work
I expected the co-operation in the Legislature of Mr.
O'Conor and Mr. Evarts. This arrangement was defeated
by subsequent events. I thought that it was necessary to
concentrate myself upon a very few measures in order to
accomplish anything. The general demoralization growing
out of the Civil War and paper money had produced
widespread effects. The corrupt power which had just been
overthrown in this city had its origin in a partnership of
plunder between men nominally of different politics, but,
in fact, of no politics at all, and had established e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>xtensive
affiliations throughout the State in both parties and in both
branches of the dominant party which now possessed three-quarters
of the Legislature. It had been necessary to the
system that the capitol should be surrounded by an atmosphere
of corruption. The ambition of some had been
tempted; the interests of more had been addressed by making
legislative business profitable, and the golden showers
had sprinkled benefits in every direction. Some, even, who
would not take an actual part in the saturnalia were content
to be silent spectators or consenting witnesses. I never for
a moment supposed that the knife and the cautery would
be agreeable remedies, or that the silent partners of prosperous
criminals would fall in love with those whose duty it
is to detect and punish. I knew, therefore, that obstructions,
under every pretext, were to be met at every step and
to be overcome. Let us thankfully accept what has been
accomplished; and let us here to-night renew our faith that
if the bar of this city and State will be united and persistent,
every judicial reform in respect to men and in respect
to systems will be at last successfully achieved."</p>

<p>"The Cincinnati movement has been so early and long

were important and not easily turned aside from the channel
it made for itself. Our people, in being educated to
favor it, had become accustomed to count on it, and at last
became dependent upon it. I never saw how its acts were
capable of readjustment, or how the question now before us
would be other than the simple issue between Grant and
Greeley. On this I concur with the instinctive sense of our
people that a change is necessary in the Federal administration.
It is rarely, if ever, possible for a party in office to
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>form itself by the internal force of its best elements. We

gross. As facts stand, I think it was wise to put him up,
and I can see my way clear to vote for him, as he can be
made of use in driving negroes out of office; but it is hard
to speak for him. But for you and Kernan I would not
move this fall. As it is, I will do what I can.</p>

<h3>WHY KERNAN WAS NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR<br />

(INTERVIEW WITH "HERALD" REPORTER, NOV. 3, 1872)</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span>&mdash;Understanding that you had some agency
in the nomination of Francis Kernan as the Democratic
and Liberal Republican candidate for Governor, I have
called to make some inquiries about it. Will Mr. Kernan
be elected?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Tilden</span> (smiling).&mdash;You remember the old adage
which says, 'You can't tell who is Governor till after the
election'? But at the risk of violating that, I will give you
an opinion. I feel very certain that Francis Kernan will
be the next Governor of the State of New York.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span>&mdash;Are you willing to state the motives for
nominating Mr. Kernan?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Tilden.</span>&mdash;I am perfectly willing to state <i>my</i> motives,
so far as I had any agency in the nomination. Mr.
Kernan will be 'the right man in the right place.' It is
scarcely possible to find a man to whom the public interests
can be so safely trusted. He is in the meridian of life and
the maturity of his powers. He has acknowledged abilities.
He has led a distinguished career as a lawyer. He possesses
large knowledge and experience of public affairs, while he
scarcely ever held office. He has inspired universal confidence
in his most absolute integrity, and enjoys the esteem
and affection of the people of the central portions of the
State, and of all who know him everywhere else. Every
circumstance about him conspires to assure his single-minded
fidelity to the duties of his great trust.</p>

<p>"In the <i>first</i> place, he has a high standard of public conduct.
He is imbued with the traditions of the best days
of the Democracy. Like Jefferson, he would not attempt to
increase his fortune, even by legitimate methods, while in
public life. Like Silas Wright and Flagg and Marcy, he
would not only be pure himself, but would disdain to use
impure influence&mdash;impure methods or impure men for party
objects. His ideals are all lofty.</p>

<p>"In the <i>second</i> place, he is not over-ambitious. He does
not aim at a permanent public life, but to serve out his
term and return to the congenial pursuit of his p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>rofession.</p>

<p>"In the <i>third</i> place, he is totally free from all ambiguous
associations. He stands on no 'ring.' He owes nobody anything
for political favors.</p>

<p>"Here are reasons enough, and good ones, but not all.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span>&mdash;What were the others? The Republican
newspapers say that one was that Mr. Kernan is a Catholic,
and that you advised his nomination on that account.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Tilden.</span>&mdash;There is not the slightest truth, or resemblance
to truth, in that story. But I will speak of that
subject presently. The other reason is the connection Mr.
Kernan had with the reform movement last year.</p>


<h4>"<i>City Frauds.</i></h4>

<p>"The discovery of frauds by certain city officials happened
just as I was about leaving the city to spend a week
in the country. On the eve of my departure I had an opportunity
of cross-examining a gentleman who had the confidence
of the financial men and taxpayers of this city, and
who called on me with a letter from a distinguished philanthropist.
I became satisfied that the revelations were substantially
true. My week's reflections in the country resulted
in a determination to attempt to carry out that system
of measures in which I have been ever since engaged; but
some co-operation was indispensable.</p>


<h4>"<i>Kernan and O'Conor.</i></h4>

<p>"The first man I sought was Francis Kernan. After
much telegraphing I found him attending court in Albany.
I went there to meet him. It was on the fourth day of
August, 1871. He was about to leave for the seashore to
attend a sick relative. I gave him the documents. I submitted
to him my views as to what ought to be done, and
arranged for a further conference on his return. On that
occasion he gave me assurances of his full and cordial co-operation,
which I ever afterwards received. He was to
me the one necessary man for a contest in the State convention.
His courage, his independence, his tact and eloquence
in debate, his popularity and weight of character
were all needed.</p>

<p>"I next sought Charles O'Conor. I desired his co-operati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>on
in a different department. His great renown as a
lawyer, his unmatched resources in a professional controversy,
his lofty independence, and his high sense of public
duty made him invaluable in many things which were necessary
in order to achieve an overthrow of the corrupt
dynasty which then ruled our great metropolis and to purify
the administration of justice.</p>

<p>"Now it so happened that both of these gentlemen are
Americans, born within this State; that they are both sons
of exiles, for the sake of liberty, from Ireland; that they are
both of the Catholic religion. Mr. Kernan's creed had
nothing more to do with my desire for his nomination for
Governor than it had with my seeking his co-operation, or
Mr. O'Conor's co-operation in the reform measures. The
only mode in which the question of creed came to be discussed
with reference to Mr. Kernan's nomination was
afterwards, when, notwithstanding his eminent fitness was
conceded, it was said that the Republicans would attack
him on account of his religious opinions. Every rogue in
the State became greatly troubled on the subject. Every
member of a corrupt ring, by interest, was opposed to him
and thought that his nomination would eliminate the Protestant
vote. I think they could have forgiven his religion
if they could only have ceased to fear his honesty. For one,
I was not disposed to concede much to such an objection.
I never said anything about Mr. Kernan's religion except
to defend him. I should have been as much in favor of his
nomination if he had been of a different creed. Mr. Kernan
is totally free from bigotry. His liberal views on every
subject of sectarian controversy are on record in his speeches
and in his conduct. In exercising the powers of an official
trust his just and equitable character would be an impassible
barrier against partiality towards any class to which
he should himself belong. Are you ready to adopt the
principle that no man, however superior in merits and qualifications,
who is a Catholic, shall be eligible to high public
office in this great commonwealth of freemen and equals?
Such a</p>


<h4>"<i>Proscription</i></h4>

<p>is not only unjust, but it is <i>unwise</i> and <i>self-destructive</i>, with
reference to the interests you wish to protect. If your apprehensions
were anything but imaginary, you direct them
in the wrong quarter. Ambitious politicians seek to win
those classes with whom they have no natural relations. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
was not Southern men, like Washington and Jefferson and
Jackson, who conceded most to slavery; it was Northern men,
like Pierce and Buchanan. A Protestant American demagogue&mdash;and
particularly if he had once been a Know-nothing&mdash;would
do things to catch votes or win popularity
among a class which a Kernan, an O'Conor, or a John
Kelly would reject with disdain.</p>


<h4>"<i>City Reformers.</i></h4>

<p>"New York is a cosmopolitan city. According to the
census of 1865, rather more than three-fifths of the voters
were naturalized. In the other two-fifths are included the
sons of naturalized citizens. How reform in municipal administration
or good government in the city is to be worked
out by a moral proscription of the foreign voters or of the
religious belief of the most numerous class of them, it is not
easy to see. Every such effort is calculated to band them
together in a compact mass. Large numbers of them joined
in the reform movement of 1871. If among their classes,
or among Americans descended from them, spring up citizens
foremost in all the community for talents and virtues
and devotion to our American ideas of government and society,
I would not challenge the honorable pride they awaken
in those of common origin. I share that pride in such men
as Kernan and O'Conor. I would not weaken any power of
leadership which the natural sentiments of humanity may
give them in these numerous classes. I would rather see
it stronger than it is in men like these, who would never
seek to create any class influence, and would never abuse
any influence, but rather exercise every power as a trust for
the public good. I had occasion, after the election last
year, in frequent addresses on municipal reform, to lament
the apathy of many of our citizens whose reproach it is
that while by pecuniary independence and leisure and all
the legitimate elements of a just and honorable public influence
they selfishly abdicate their power of leadership in
the affairs of our great metropolis. Wherever a man appears
in the commonwealth who is without venality or the
inferior forms of ambition, but from an elevated sense of
his duty as a citizen of the commonwealth, he ought to be
encouraged and his natural elements of influence respected
and cherished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too late in the day to revive the spirit of the native
American or Know-nothing parties. The only purely American
stock which remains on this continent is the whole population
of the Southern States, who are now under the
carpet-bag governments, upheld by the banded masses of
rogues and the influence of the Federal governments and
affiliated with the Republican party. In the North we are
one-third emigrants of the last twenty-five years or their
children. The great migration of the last quarter of a
century is the most remarkable in the world's history. It
has exercised a controlling power over every important event
of our national progress. In that period about seven millions
of people have come to our Northern States. I had occasion
some years ago to analyze the character of that immigration.
I found that it contained just about twice as
many male persons between the ages of 15 and 40 as our
resident population in 1860. In other words, it contained
the population of the virile age equal to that of fourteen
millions of our average people. It is that influx which has
created our great cities, which has built our railroads and
furnished them business, and which has produced the immense
growth of our Northern States in population, wealth,
and prosperity. It is that influx which overturned the
equality of influence between the North and South in the
Federal government, and stimulated both sides to the measure
that led to the Civil War. It is that influx which would
have given the North predominance if the war had not
happened, and which gave it the victory in the conflict of
arms, abolished slavery, and will at last fill the South with
communities like our own.</p>

<p>"This is the state of things. Who could alter it if he
would? Who dare say that, on the whole, he would alter
it if he could?</p>

<p>"We must, then, avoid all those civil and social revolutions,
work out as best we may the problem of self-government
formed on equal and universal suffrage. We can only
do so on the large, liberal statesmanship on which we began,
and never by going back toward the dark night of proscription
and bigotry."</p>


<h3>TILDEN TO MRS. CASSIDY</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Feb'y 22, 1873</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Cassidy</span>,&mdash;I regret that any del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ay should
take place in sending you a statement of the results of the
investment made by me for your benefit. But the computations
were somewhat long, and needed either help or instructions
from me to enable Mr. Smith to complete them,
which, until now, I was not able to give.</p>

<p>"I had hoped before this time to see you and be able to
say that, if there is anything in your affairs in which I can
offer you suggestion or counsel for the benefit of yourself
and your little ones, I shall be glad to be of service to you.</p>

<p>"About the time&mdash;indeed, a little before I recd. the
$10,000 remittance&mdash;when Mr. Cassidy had told me it
would be sent I invested some $15,000 for you. I sold
enough the other day to pay the balance due me for allowances.</p>

<p>"The investment has gained some $1700, besides interest
compounded and quarterly. The stock would have sold for
5 per cent. more last year, which would have been $750
additional.</p>

<p>"But investments generally show about that difference;
and if you continue to want such an investment for income,
it can now be made advantageously.</p>

<p>"The Cleveland and Pittsburg stock is about 3&frac12; per
cent. lower, and yields the same income.</p>

<p>"Well-selected gold-interest 7-p.-c. bonds, if bought at 85
or a little under, will give a larger income. They should be
selected with caution. Now, three courses are open:</p>

<p>"1. If you need the <i>money</i> the stock can at once be
sold.</p>

<p>"2. The stock can be transferred to your name if you do
not wish to change the investment. In that event, it had
better be put in your name; for the motive to keep the account
open has ceased.</p>

<p>"The stock is perfectly safe as can be&mdash;gives quarterly
dividends, and is free from all income tax, and I think
from all personal taxes in this State. The dividends have
the security of the great earnings&mdash;$1,750,000 now above
the cent, and the guaranty of the Penn. R. R. Co., with
its $65,000,000 of capital, paying ten per cent., and worth
120.</p>

<p>"But, no doubt, some bond could be found that might pay
a little more. If Mr. Cassidy had lived I intended to change
to something which would give more income, though I think
I was rather more cautious in doing it than he inclined to
be. For, after all&mdash;especially with a lady&mdash;certain security
is the first consideration. We are doubtless now, as we have
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>en for several years past, on a gradually receding scale of
values, in which the attempt at large profits involves more
risk than it did at an earlier period.</p>

<p>"I write hastily, but thus fully that you may know the
whole situation. Consult with your advisers, and let me
know your wishes.</p>

<p>"I remain, Dear Mrs. Cassidy,</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,&mdash;I have been waiting until something
should turn up cheap enough and, at the same time, safe
enough to warrant the reinvestment of your money. There
are gold-interest-bearing bonds at about 90&mdash;7 p. c.; but I
wanted something cheaper. I sometimes hesitate about
taking for you what involves so much reliance on one's own
judgment as is necessary, where you buy securities new
and not well established in the market.</p>

<p>"Some time ago I bought 50 bonds on two railroads&mdash;now
consolidated in Texas. One is the Houston and Great
Northern R. R., the other the International R. R.</p>

<p>"The bonds are $16,000 per mile, and many of our best
business men have invested in the stock, which is issued at
$16,000 per mile. I think the lines likely to be productive,
and the investment is managed with a cautious and conservative
spirit. I gave 82&frac12; and the accrued interest for
these bonds. I will let you have enough of them to come
to your money and interest while it has been in my hands
at 7 p. c., tho' I generally have a considerable sum lying in
bank at 5&mdash;say, 40 or 50,000$.</p>

<p>"We sold 6 of your bonds, which gave 6 per cent., or
$360 in gold.</p>

<p>"By taking off one coupon&mdash;if you can wait&mdash;the money
and interest would buy about 7 of these bonds. That would
give 490 in gold, or a gain of 130 a year in gold.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1873, Mr. Tilden, for the first time,
visited the Old World. While there he sent the following
note, addressed, I presume, to John Kelly, then supreme in
Tammany Hall. In this assigning reasons for his mistrust
of the Republican party, the organization of which was contemporaneous
with the commencement of the Civil War of
1860-61.</p>


<h3>KEY-NOTE OF FEDERAL POLITICS IN 1873</h3>

<p>"In the sixteen years during which it will have been in
possession of the government at the expiration of the present
Presidential term, all the evils which call so loudly for
redress have had their origin, their persistent and daily
growth. Nearly all its thinkers, speakers, and writers, its
active intellect and its power of leadership are imbued with
strong government theories of so extravagant a character that
even Hamilton would have disowned and doubtless would
have condemned them. The classes who desire pecuniary
profit from existing governmental abuses have become numerous
and powerful beyond any example in our country.
The myriads of officeholders, with enhanced salaries, and
often with illicit gains; the contractors and jobbers; the
beneficiaries of congressional grants of the public property
or of special franchises; the favored interests whose business
is rendered lucrative by legislative bounties or legislative
monopolies; the corporations whose hopes and fears are
appealed to be the measures of the government; the rapacious
hordes of carpet-baggers who have plundered the
impoverished people of the South at least ten times as much
as Tweed's Ring did the rich metropolis, and whose fungus
growth is intertwined with the roots of the Republican
party; all these classes are not only interested in perpetuating
existing evils and existing wrongs, but they are the
main agencies and instruments by which that work is done."</p>

<p>This is the key-note of Mr. Tilden's view of our Federal
politics in 1873. Unhappily, there is nothing in this statement
upon which we can boast to-day of any considerable
improvement.</p>


<h3>MR. TILDE<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>N RESIGNS THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATIC

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I shall not be able to return home
in season to take part in the political canvass of this fall, I
desire through you to request the delegate to the State convention
who will be chosen from my district to say for me
that I decline a re-election as member-at-large of the State
committee and as its chairman.</p>

<p>"What the country now needs in order to save it is a
revival of the Jeffersonian democracy, with the principles
of government and rules of administration, and with the
high standard of official morality which were established by
the political revolution of 1800. At that time the infant
institutions of the republic were imperilled by the same
evil tendencies which have to-day attained a larger development.
The demoralizations of war&mdash;a spirit of gambling
adventure, engendered by false systems of public finance;
a grasping centralism, absorbing all functions from the local
authorities, and assuming to control the industries of individuals
by largesses to favored classes from the public
treasury of moneys wrung from the body of the people by
taxation&mdash;were then, as now, characteristics of the period.
The party which swayed the government, though embracing
many elevated characters, was dominated, as an organization,
by the ideas of its master-spirit, Alexander Hamilton.
Himself personally pure, he nevertheless believed that our
American people must be governed, if not by force, at least
by appeals to the selfish interests of classes, in all the forms
of corrupt influence. I recently met here&mdash;in the birthplace
of Albert Gallatin&mdash;a son of that great man, and himself
a distinguished American. Speaking in the light of the
unsullied traditions of that day, as well as of its public
history, he said that the jobbery and corruption and laxity
of official morals were as great, proportionally, then as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>now.
If this be a true judgment, the reaction which was effected
and which gave us half a century of comparatively pure administration
is an encouragement that official morals and
public life may be again lifted from degradation. As the
means of the reaction of 1800, Thomas Jefferson founded
and organized the Democratic party. He set up anew the
broken foundations of governmental power. He stayed the
advancing centralism. He restored the rights of the States
and the localities. He repressed the meddling of government
in the concerns of private business, remitting the management
of the industries of the country to the domain of
the individual judgment and conscience. He not only
brought the administration into conformity with principles
which lessen the occasions and the motives for corruption,
but he enforced, by precept and by example, purity and disinterestedness
in official life. He refused to appoint relatives
to office. He declined all presents. He refrained,
while in the public service, from all enterprises to increase
his private fortune.</p>

<p>The immense ascendency over the public opinion of the
country acquired by Mr. Jefferson&mdash;the complete triumph
of the party he formed and led, the acceptance at length by
the whole people of him as the highest political authority&mdash;shaped
the course of government in the United States for
half a century. That period will stand in all history as the
golden age of the republic.</p>

<p>The reformatory work of Mr. Jefferson in 1800 must
now be repeated. Organizations and names are important
only as they are available for the result. Every patriotic
citizen, sincerely desirous of reform, should discard all
prejudices and accept the benefaction from any source which
is capable of providing it.</p>

<p>But it is quite clear that the Republican party now
swaying the administration, although it embraces large numbers
of honorable and patriotic citizens, is, as a whole, incapable
of this specific mission. In the sixteen years during
which it will have been in possession of the government
at the expiration of the present Presidential term, all the
evils which call so loudly for redress have had their origin,
their persistent and daily growth. Nearly all its thinkers,
speakers and writers, its active intellect and its power of
leadership, are imbued with strong-government theories of
so extravagant a character that even Hamilton would hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>e
disowned and doubtless would have condemned them. The
classes who desire pecuniary profit from existing governmental
abuses have become numerous and powerful beyond
any example in our country. The myriads of officeholders,
with enhanced salaries, and often with illicit gains; the
contractors and jobbers; the beneficiaries of Congressional
grants of the public property or of special franchises; the
favored interests whose business is rendered lucrative by
legislative bounties or legislative monopolies; the corporations
whose hopes and fears are appealed to by the measures
of the government; the rapacious hordes of carpet-baggers
who have plundered the impoverished people of the South
at least ten times as much as Tweed's Ring did the rich
metropolis, and whose fungus growth is intertwined with
the roots of the Republican party; all these classes are not
only interested in perpetuating existing evils and existing
wrongs, but they are the main agencies and instruments by
which that work is done. They furnish organization, they
supply numerous partisans who devote themselves to electioneering
while the honest citizens are compelled to earn
their daily bread by the sweat of their brow; they contribute
and aggregate vast sums of money to be expended in
conducting party canvasses, in influencing the elections and
in corrupting the voters; sums which no number of disinterested
citizens could furnish if equally unscrupulous in
the methods of political influence. For the first time in our
national history such classes have become powerful enough
to aspire to be in America the ruling classes, as they have
been and are in the corrupt societies of the Old World.
They threaten to reproduce here a state of things often
found elsewhere, in which the governmental machine, with
its allies and dependents, is capable of setting itself up
against and over the whole mass of unorganized citizens who
follow the avocations of private life. These classes completely
possess the organization of the Republican party.
They have absorbed the Republican party. They are, for
all practical purposes, the Republican party. They make
its nominations; they shape its measures, they preserve its
policy. Individual dissenters who preserve the original traditions
of American free government there are, but their
voices are not heard; they are generally paralyzed; they
are always powerless. Hitherto no Democratic minority has
been formed capable of exercising any practical power. No
internal remedy can come for a disease which has incorpo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>rated
itself with everything vital in the political body.
It is too late to cut out the cancer without killing the
patient.</p>

<p>"In the nature of the case, the remedy can come only
from an opposition which shall grow strong enough to turn
out the present existing administration and take its place.
In such an opposition the Democratic masses must contribute
a large element. They embrace three and a half or
four millions of votes, and are of themselves within five per
cent. of a majority. They contain nearly all the thinkers,
speakers and writers, all the trained statesmen who adhere
to the traditions of Jefferson; and while individual members
have been not unstained with the errors of the times,
the body, as a whole, is sound; and a majority is sure to
declare for the ancient faith of Jefferson and Franklin and
George Clinton and Samuel and John Hancock.</p>

<p>"In the part I have borne in the administration of the
Democratic party of the State of New York&mdash;now closed&mdash;I
have aimed at three things:</p>

<p>"1. To lead on public opinion in favor of the original
ideas of the Jeffersonian democracy and in support of such
current measures as secured valuable reforms.</p>

<p>"2. To terminate a degrading strife in which they enlisted
themselves, in comparing the leprous spots on their
respective sides, and practically declared that the word only
was wanting to incite an honorable emulation in which they
should seek and apply effectual remedies and the public
mind stimulated to reform.</p>

<p>"3. To prepare the Democratic masses to act their part
in a general movement for reform in all the governmental
institutions of the country. (<i>C&aelig;tera desunt.</i>)</p>

<h3>MAYOR HAVEMEYER'S MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF
AZARIAH C. FLAGG</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">"<i>November, 1873.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>"It is with profound sorrow that I communicate to you
officially the intelligence that Azariah C. Flagg died at his
residence in this city on the evening of the 24th. At the
close of the next month it will be fifteen years since the
public career of this eminent citizen was terminated. In
that interval, totally bereft of eyesight, but with an intellect
clear and strong, and a spirit courageous and serene, he has
lived in complete retirement, fulfilling some private trusts,
and ever thoughtful of all public interests. At last, when a
few days would have completed an age of eighty-three years,
he has passed from among us.</p>

<p>"There are peculiarities in the public career and public
character of Mr. Flagg which make it specially fit
that the people of this State, and the people of this city,
should pause a moment in their busy life to render a conspicuous
homage to him as his mortal remains pass to the
tomb.</p>

<p>"He was born in Orwell, in the State of Vermont, on the
28th of November, 1790. In early youth he migrated to
Plattsburg, in this State. He had an honorable share in
the defence of that place against the British invasion in the
war of 1812-15. He sought a frugal livelihood as editor and
printer of the Plattsburg <i>Republican</i>, a Democratic newspaper.
In November, 1822, he was elected by the friends
of Clinton to the Assembly. He served in that body with
distinction during the sessions of 1823 and 1824. In February,
1826, he was elected Secretary of State by the Legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and held that office until Jan., 1833, when he was
elected Comptroller. He held the latter office until 1839.
He was restored to it in 1842, and continued to hold it until
the close of 1847. His official service consisted of two years
in the Assembly and 19 years in the Canal Board, as Comptroller,
as Secy. of State; and his unofficial service was even
more valuable during the three years from 1839 to 1842.
His career in State administration may be counted as 25
years.</p>

<p>"In this career of a quarter of a century in the administration
of the State, Mr. Flagg's merit and renown will be
found not in the catalogue of the great offices he held, but
in the wise measures and honest policy he originated or
maintained&mdash;in the ability, vigor, and courage with which
he pursued the right and confronted the wrong, and in the
great fact that he invariably wielded official power and party
leadership for the cause of good government, for purity in
legislation and in administration; that he used these great
influences, not for the purposes of individual ambition or
personal gain, but exclusively and undeviatingly for the
public good; that he contributed very largely to keep up
and to elevate the standard and the tone of official and
political morals in both parties and in the whole public
during this long period in the greatest State of the Union.
Mr. Flagg was united with Martin Van Buren, whose organizing
genius and masterly abilities created the association;
with Silas Wright and William L. Marcy, also statesmen
of the first class. They were all men of probity, frugality,
and personal virtue, and they drew to their side similar
characters in all parts of the State. Mr. Flagg made the
State finances his specialty; and surpassed all his associates
in enterprise and courage, though he may not have equalled
them in general attainments, and was often the most effective
leader in this State.</p>

<p>"In the six years from 1853 to 1859, Mr. Flagg served
as Comptroller of this city; and although he did not attempt
any political leadership, his career was distinguished
by the fidelity and firmness with which he resented all invasions
of the municipal treasury; and his persistent and
unwearied exertions in this service no doubt hastened the
malady by which, at nearly the allotted age of man, closed
forever his vision upon the light of the heavens.</p>

<p>"It may safely be said that the hist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>ory of the country
affords no equal example of a life devoted for so long a
period with so much affirmative activity, and with so much
ability and skill, to the abstract cause of good government
in the civil administration of the community in which Providence
had cast his lot.</p>

<p>"At a period when the people everywhere are feeling
how much they need such virtues and such services, we ought
to signalize our appreciation of so remarkable an example,
if only as an incentive to its imitation."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">"<span class="smcap">N. Y.</span>, <i>Nov. 14, 1873</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Henry</span>,&mdash;I have but a moment. I am pressed
on every side with urgent demands.</p>

<p>"There will be no use in your asking me for any further
aid, unless you can make up your mind to abandon your
pride and imperious will, and come to terms which I have
so long advised for your own good and which I ought long
ago to have enforced for my own peace and safety.</p>

<p>"I scarcely like to repeat my ideas, because I frequently
hear, through indirect channels, of your complaint that I
go back 18 years, and so you don't wish to talk with me.</p>

<p>"Now, I never have recurred to painful topics merely
to wound, but only to try to impress the lessons which you
ought to have derived from your own experience, but which
you never would admit to me, and which you have never
acted on. If it is hopeless to expect that you will correct
errors&mdash;if you are too proud to admit them&mdash;what resource
have I but to keep that which is [left] out of your power?
What hope is there that anything I can do will be of any
permanent use to you or your family? What can I do but
turn away my thoughts from a man&mdash;this affair, which has
cost me more anxiety, trouble, hazard of my own affairs
and of health than everybody and everything in life&mdash;who
grabs anything of mine he can lay his hands on without
asking me, never consults me about restoring it, and thinks
it right to do just as he pleases about incurring new expenditures
and operations in preference to paying his creditors,
whom he does not think it necessary to consult, or, indeed,
to have any rights but to submit to what he, in his supreme
good pleasure, chooses to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>"In prudence and in morality you have much to do to
regain my good opinion. The first thing is to see and admit
your errors. The next is to show signs of amending them.</p>

<p>"1. An ordinary creditor would have a right to know,
frankly and truly, the situation of a debtor. Still more
so would a man who was aiding as a matter of favor&mdash;friendship
or affection.</p>

<p>"In twenty years I have been able to get nothing from
you which was not wrung out, even when I was making new
advances at great sacrifices. Then as scanty as possible. I
never had any information about your Michigan transactions.
I never have been able to get information in season
to advise about the shaping of your plans.</p>

<p>"You have seemed to think that everybody ought to
accept your own view of your affairs&mdash;allow you to embark
in new undertakings money justly due to your creditors
without their consent or knowledge&mdash;and that it was almost
a piece of impertinence for them to wish to know anything
about their own money."</p>

<h3>ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 1876
(REPORT OF A CONVERSATION WITH GOV. TILDEN IN 1874)</h3>

<p>"Your correspondent not having the liberty of an interview,
nevertheless had the privilege of a conversation,
not at all private, worthy of public consideration.</p>

<p>"His Excellency was reminded that he could not be an
unobservant spectator of the circumstance that the leaders
of both political parties are discussing Presidential questions
and canvassing the claims of opposed candidates in
both. He promptly responded that that concerned him the
least whilst he had serious duties to perform. The Presidency,
he said, is not strictly before the people at all in
this canvass. They are to elect legislators who should improve
the laws, and executive State officers to administer
the same. A constitutional amendment contemplates cutting
off extra compensations to contractors, but it does not
prohibit the Legislature from charging work in the interest
'of the contractor,' besides authorizing 'the Canal Board'
to cancel such (contractor's) contract. This shows the vital
importance of electing a sound Legislature and a safe Canal
Board. The practice has been too much to pass laws in the
interest of the sinister, the evil, and the profligate classes;
and the same have been administered accordingly, until the
rights and interests of the honest and industrial classes have
been greatly ignored and the common prosperity well-nigh
paralyzed. The State has just now a far deeper interest
in home government than in the national concerns. We
need not overlook the frauds and extravagances of the Washington
government, but we shall find on hand full enough
to do if we arrest and redress the abuses that pervade our
cities, towns, and counties, and particularly the State, for
this year, leaving the selection of members of Congress and
Presidential electors to their proper time another year.</p>

<p>"His Excellency was further reminded that he could not
overlook the fact that the prominence, not to say popularity,
of his administration had led to the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> of his
name in connection with the next Presidency, and that some
rivalry consequent upon the agitation of 'home questions'
had led to the favoring of candidates beyond the limits of
our own State.</p>

<p>"His Excellency promptly (and rather nervously) responded
that public opinion will be very apt to take care of
such interests and issues. He had seen enough to satisfy
him that he who escapes the cares and responsibilities of
public life is far happier than he who enjoys its supposed
honors and emoluments. He could most heartily and trustfully
support the superior claims (as they are miscalled)
of New York's favorite son and foremost statesman.</p>

<p>"Of course, this was understood to refer to Governor
Seymour. So his Excellency was reminded that it was objected
that he had had his opportunity, and also that our
State has had both of the last two chances for the Presidency.</p>

<p>"'Oh, that is a superficial, if not sinister, view of the
case,' promptly rejoined my interlocutor. 'The public no
longer cares what State or section candidates come from.
They may be taken from one or the other, or both from
either, and the people will not care, so long as the men and
measures are acceptable. Gov. Seymour was nominated
eight years ago against his wishes and his friends', with the
tacit if not expressed understanding that he and they were
making a sacrifice at the time to a political exigency. The
same, pretty much, may be said in the case of the lamented
Greeley. New York has no local claims (any more than
the "mother of Presidents" of old had); neither has she
any local disabilities. But there is no use of discussing
these matters, as he said before. We have more appropriate
and pressing work in hand. When that is done it will be
time enough to bother our heads about other political concerns.'</p>

<p>"His Excellency was badgered a little on the reports of
his alleged ill health, but he was disposed to treat it as 'an
invention of the enemy.' Yet he expressed jocosely the
hope that his own constitution might soon experience a respite
from his sedentary confinement, as well as the bad
habits of public life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am opposed to selecting a candidate for Governor
from the judges of the Court of Appeals. Either Hon.
Clarkson N. Potter or Hon. John Ganson would make a fair
candidate, but my first and last choice is yourself. My
position in your case is precisely what you know it was at
the time, in 1872, our mutual and esteemed friend, Hon.
Francis Kernan, was talked of as a probable nominee. Mr.
Kernan's religious convictions were the first, if not the only
objection suggested by those opposed to his nomination;
in your case the first if not the only objection urged is that
your courageous and successful attack upon a corrupt ring
in our party will lessen the vote for you, it being always
suggested in this connection that the old and corrupt ring
still control a large vote, especially in your city. I say away
with such abject fears! If our party friends will not support
brave, honest men because a ring of plunderers and their
retainers may be displeased, then let our opponents succeed,
and we will at least escape the responsibility always attending
political power. This has been and is my position on
the question.</p>

letter which came to hand to-day. Enclosed find a corrected
list of working-men as you desire.</p>

<p>"I also assume the liberty of addressing you the following,
which please consider confidential. The position of
things in this county and the influences which I believe are
working against yourself prompt these suggestions.</p>

<p>"The <i>regular committees</i> of our city and county will
send to the State convention 12 delegates, all able, prominent,
representative, and live working-men and Democrats.
They are, I think, with good reason, unanimously in favor
of your nomination. There will, however, be a contesting
delegation from here, made from powers wielded by a
county committee which commenced its existence about 4
months since, which is being controlled by its president,
John McEwen, and supported by the <i>Argus</i>. I think I
hazard nothing in stating that in my judgment this last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
delegation, together with the entire power of the <i>Argus</i> and
the 'Canal Ring' here, which support them, are inimical
to your nomination and will do all they can to defeat you.
The developments which have been watched, and especially
these within the last two days in connection with the Liberal
Republican convention, I think fully sustain all I say, and
even <i>more</i>. The whole of these 3 powers were used to their
utmost strength during the last 2 days to drive you from
the field and to force the renomination of Mr. Church.
This plan was fought against by our delegation and those
acting therewith, and to their ingenious and proper management
in a great degree is the result attributable which
prevented the naming of Mr. Church by their convention.
The <i>Argus</i>, McEwen, and their supporters, we believe, are
doing all they can to fill up your path. We are disposed
to keep it clear and to give you our individual support.</p>

<p>"You are, of course, aware that <i>our</i> admission to the
State convention is to be opposed as bitterly as it can be
by the <i>same powers</i> which are named above as being opposed
<i>to you</i>. We are therefore very anxious to receive your
support in procuring our admission as regular delegates
into said convention. The self-same persons, we believe,
which are massed against us are consolidated agst. you.
The success of our delegation will add to your soldiers.
Knowing you will have much to say in regard to the committee
before whom we must appear, I sincerely trust you
will see that it is so composed that bolting committee delegations
cannot oust those who represent the regular committees
from this county, who have aided you in fighting
our political battles so ably for the last 40 years. When
I can be of further service, please let me know. Shall be
happy to acknowledge any attention you may conclude to
extend.</p>

canal official is at work to keep your friends out of the convention.
In Oneida we have more than one hundred miles
of canals running into all sections of its territory. I shall
not be surprised if I encounter a sharp opposition to-morrow.
It is not open opposition alone which is to be contended

The matter of a candidate for Governor has been canvassed
for weeks; it has been understood by us all that Judge
Church would not take a nomination; there were many reasons
why, being chief justice, he should not vacate the position
and leave it to be filled by appointment for a year.
Your name has been canvassed, and your friends have taken
strong ground in favor of your nomination; now those who
have been opposed to you, not your friends, ask you to retire
that Judge Church may be nominated. In my judgment
you should not take the responsibility of this step;
the matter has progressed so far that I think you should
leave the matter to your friends and the convention which
is about to assemble. I see no other way out of the matter

will not pardon him; will you? If his friends have your

half million into a fund for your success? Then let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>

Let the temperance men be paid and their organizations

his district&mdash;both in getting out the Democrats and taking

<h3>TILDEN FOR GOVERNOR<br />

(THE COURSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PRESS REVIEWED)</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the New York "Tribune"</i>)
</p>

<p>It is very much to the credit of the administration journals
of the State that, so far as they discussed beforehand
the claims and qualifications of the several candidates for
the Democratic nomination for Governor, they frankly recognized
the fact that the logic of the Democratic professions
of reform pointed unmistakably to the gentleman who was
nominated at Syracuse on Thursday. Indeed, they almost
may be said to have advised and urged his nomination. In
doing this we give them credit for rising above the narrowness
of partisanship, and for taking into view the great public
benefit to be derived from having for the candidates of both
parties men of distinguished ability and unimpeachable integrity,
instead of following the instincts of a petty and
unpatriotic selfishness by endeavoring to induce their opponents
to weaken and stultify themselves. Mr. Tilden, at
no small risk of personal popularity and political influence,
and with no conceivable motive but a desire for the public
good, had fairly revolutionized his own party. In arresti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>ng
the corrupt and profligate career of the Ring that ruled it,
he has contributed to its temporary defeat. But the movement
he led was a success, and the party was shrewd enough
to discern in the signs of the times the wisdom of assuming
the responsibility and claiming the credit for the reform.
They have done this persistently.</p>

<p>It was plain enough to the most casual observer that
from the moment Mr. Tilden consented to have his name
presented as the candidate for Governor of the party to
which he had been so conspicuous in administering discipline,
that party could not reject him without confessing the
insincerity of its boasting over what was in so marked degree
his work. Not to have nominated him would have
been justly considered a rebuke and a warning to any and
all who should hereafter put party success in jeopardy for
the sake of putting a stop to public robbery. The administration
newspapers which pointed out the folly and danger
of such a course deserve praise for rising above the small
strategy, hypocrisy, and trickery so common in politics. We
have already expressed the opinion that the convention
which nominated Mr. Tilden was driven to it by the logic
of events and as a consequence of its professions of reform.
That the nomination is offensive to a considerable number
of the party, who were directly or indirectly disturbed by
Tweed's overthrow, is an admitted fact; and there was, no
doubt, considerable hesitation in the minds of many influential
leaders over the question whether, upon the whole, it
would be safe to offend these people for the sake of making
a consistent record for the party.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Tilden himself, it can be of comparatively
little consequence to him personally now whether he is or
is not elected. He has accomplished a great work in his
party, has led a great reform, overthrown a powerful organization
of municipal thieves, and compelled a recognition of
his services more emphatic and pronounced in the mere
form of the nomination than an election could be under any
other circumstances. We presume he has not deceived himself
with the idea that the administration journals which
have heretofore bestowed upon him such copious praise, and
have so frankly pointed out to his party his strength as a
candidate, have thereby estopped themselves from attacking
his principles and his character. As citizens, the gentl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>emen
who conduct these newspapers are doubtless glad to be
assured that, whatever may be the result of the election,
the office of Governor will be filled by an able and upright
gentleman of whom they need not be ashamed. As partisans,
however, they propose to find whatever joints there
may be in his harness and to defeat him if they can. One
organ, we perceive already, after remarking that it does not
know positively that if elected he would misuse the power
intrusted to him, calls attention to the fact that he has acted
as counsel for some of the greatest railroad corporations in
the State, and suggests in a wise way that it might be very
dangerous at this time to put such a man in the executive
chair. Another gives him credit for his services in overthrowing
the Tweed Ring, but adds that he did not do it at
the right time; that he ought to have done it sooner. It
does not accuse him of dishonesty, but feels compelled to
call him a "moral coward." And so they go. Of course
there will be a great deal of it before the campaign is over,
a great deal that is mean and contemptible and dishonest,
but just now we prefer to consider the unusual honesty and
frankness with which the administration press treated the
question before the nomination, and to give credit for sincerity
and independence. When each party counsels the
other to nominate its best men, and the advice is followed,
we shall see purer politics and better government.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,&mdash;Your note came this morning, and it

about McLaughlin, for, tho a little ridiculous, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> serious;
as I had all the elements of decision I acted at once
to avoid the competition which so attractive an office was

that I acted in this case with no more celerity than I have
with three-quarters of the important appointments, and
nearly all the small ones which I have had to deal with.
For the grumble at my delays has no doubt reached you.</p>

<p>"A small coterie of rogues, who, when they first recovered
from the subduing effect of the election, started into a
life of whispers, first circulated the rumor that I had a
softening of the brain; next, that I had suffered a stroke
of paralysis; then, that I went to bed drunk every night;
and at last came to the statement that I had lost my 'snap'&mdash;that
I had not decision or energy to make proper removals
or appointments, and, indeed, had become physically
unable to make up my mind about anything.</p>

<p>"Well, under every mountain of lies there is usually a
grain of sand of truth. In the interminable conferences
with public bodies and committees and officers from Nov.
5 to Dec. 25th, I did become very weary, and felt some exhaustion
of nervous force and much indigestion. In the
hurried preparation of the message I rested; and with all
the burdens since, have recuperated, got arrears nearly
cleared off, appointments made, bills&mdash;some passed and
others ready&mdash;and my physique well-nigh restored after
six months of heavy strain.</p>

<p>"As to appointments, while the most have been despatched
rapidly as soon as reached, three classes have felt
some delay.</p>

<p>"1st. Where there was no haste, and more important
matters claimed the earlier attention. It is very likely I
have not been altogether wise, as the world is largely made
up of fools, in this respect. I am so formed constitutionally
that I concentrate on what seems of first importance, and
defer with almost contemptuous indifference what can as
well or better wait.</p>

<p>"This is the habit which has given me success in business,
in affairs, in the conduct of parties, in all things where
military organizations and strategy require a concentration
of all resources and efforts on the turning-point of the battle
to break thro the opposing lines.</p>

<p>"But the hungry office-seeker sees only the narrow personal
interest he pursues, and perhaps the appointing power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
should act consistently in respect to its general duties for
the sake of dealing with fools according to their folly. Perhaps
so.</p>

<p>"2nd. When things were to be worked out which could
only be known to the appointing power. For instance, a
gentleman sent me a memorandum from Archbishop McCloskey
suggesting two Catholic gentlemen for the Board of
State Charities. He did not know that I had but three
vacancies from N. Y., and that Mr. Jno. C. Deveraux, of
Utica, would go out by expiration of his term if not reappointed.
I sent to him to have his choice between the two
he named, if only one of them could be taken, and to inform
him about Dr. D. He gladly preferred the latter to one of
his own nominees. Mr. D., you must know, is one of the
best families of the interior, of the old and early Catholic
aristocracy&mdash;a brother-in-law of Senator Kernan. How
could I drop him?</p>

<p>"The one whom the archbishop preferred is the one who
stands at the head of your list&mdash;Henry Hoguet. Then I
wished to take one of the Hebrew persuasion if I could get
a satisfactory one. I have good names, but location may
compel me to forego this purpose.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Howard Potter, who is one of the members
resigning, making the vacancies I am to fill, has applied for
an opportunity to see me before I make the appointment.</p>

<p>"These arrangements take time, only known to me.</p>

<p>"The case delayed the most was that of judge in this
district. There were applicants from communities from all
over the district. The appointment was made in a few
hours after the last hearing was given, which it would have
been an offence to refuse. I have more doubt about the delay
in this case than in any other, but the result is general satisfaction.</p>

<p>"3rd. But the <i>real grumble</i> is from those who ask for
action which is doubtful or suspicious or which is certainly
wrong.</p>

<p>"Our friend, Mr. Speaker MacGuire's grievance is this:
There has been started the erection by the State of public
buildings at four places beside the capital of a most extravagant
character. One was the Elmira Reformatory.
This was taken out of the hands of a commissioner and put
in charge of an architect. Him I have the power to remove.</p>

<p>"Soon after I came here my old acquaintance, Steve
Arnot, broke i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>n half drunk, leading in the Speaker, Charles
Walker, and Senator Bradley.</p>

<p>"He insisted that I should instantly turn out the architect
and put in a man named by him.</p>

<p>"As there was no work going on, and the change might
involve questions about contracts which had been broken&mdash;new
ones pending, others to be made, and would involve the
whole responsibility of wisdom and frugality and honesty
in the construction&mdash;I thought the Governor had better not
abdicate his functions, but had better look carefully into the
whole matter before he embarked himself and the party on
the adventure.</p>

<p>"The five buildings, including the capital, are popularly
estimated to cost 25 or 30 millions.</p>

<p>"I treated the matter very kindly, but deferred it. I
shall continue to do that until I know enough about it to
act wisely. If I change the manager it will not be for
patronage (one $4000 office of an expert), but to a man in
whom I can have a personal trust that he will not disgrace
me.</p>

<p>"My information is that the Democrats of Elmira and
the county deprecate nothing so much as a return of the
odium they have once had to bear. I had no reason to suppose
there was any special discontent until it appeared. The
Speaker had informed me he had introduced a bill which
would make all right.</p>

<p>"Since I have written so much more than I intended I
will turn back and make it personal.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 27.5em;">"Very truly, &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"I have omitted to mention several narrow escapes. The
balance is still in favor of wariness, notwithstanding some
friends get tremors."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I regret that your kind intentions
were so fruitless of effect. I am pleased, however, to
find that the intended appointment of McLaughlin is generally
approved. I am gratified, too, that Stemmler still is
in the land of the living.</p>

<p>"I met your nephew, Mr. Pelton, at Marble's, as I presume
he has so informed you, and there told him of Stemmler's
death and advised a speedy appointment to fill t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>he
vacancy. My information was from the County Clerk's
office; one of the principal clerks employed there gave me
the information, and handed me at the same time the <i>Daily
News</i>, which contained an account of the death of Stemmler.
I enclose you herein a scrap cut from that paper, and one,
too, referring to the matter afterwards.</p>


<h3>"'CITY NEWS.</h3>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Death of Judge Stemmler.</span>&mdash;Judge Stemmler of the Fourth
District Civil Court died this morning at his residence in Seventy-first
Street. Mr. Stemmler has long been an invalid. A
short time ago an abscess on his right side was operated upon,
and he was greatly benefited. Soon afterward he began to fail
and took to his bed. Deceased was 63 years of age.'</p>


<h3>"'CITY NEWS.</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">'The Man Who Will Fill Judge Stemmler's Place, Provided
the Latter Dies.</span>&mdash;Mr. J. Fairfax McLaughlin, who was
yesterday appointed to fill the supposed vacancy in the judgeship
of the Seventh District Court, is a native of Maryland, where
he practiced law for ten years before coming to New York, which
he did about four years ago. He has practiced law in this city,
but is at present a clerk in the County Clerk's office. He has
the reputation of being an elegant gentleman and scholar, speaking
several languages. Judge Stemmler, however, is still alive.'</p>

<p>"I did not suppose that you would act promptly, and
regret that the affair has occurred.</p>

<p>"Permit me to thank you for your well-disposed intention
to do this kind favor.</p>

<p>"Wm. Dunham informs me that the bill authorizing the
Board of Supervisors, or rather empowering them to remunerate
him for the care and maintenance of prisoners
committed to the debtor's gaol is now in your hands awaiting
your signature.</p>

<p>"I have had some experience in the care of the gaol, and
was paid a <i>per capita</i> for maintaining the prisoners. It's
unjust, then, to Dunham that he should not be paid. It
appears that the gaol has always been supported by the
county, yet there was no law authorizing it to be done. This
was discovered when the predecessor of Dunham sued for
his money on Green having refused to pay him. Dunham
would not have taken the place if he had known that there
was doubt about the remuneration. This law, then, as you
have evidently seen, simply allows the Board of Supervisors
to pay him what is just and proper for services rendered,
and for which he has not been paid by the county.</p>

<h3>CHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Fort Washington</span>, <i>Feb. 25, 1875</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gov.</span>,&mdash;I have perused the substitute. As a matter
of course my first thought was that of a Yankee. I set
to work guessing what could be the <i>motive</i> of the change.</p>

<p>"The substitute is so much more broadly comprehensive
than I feared the 'toned-down' document would be that
this conjecturing process led me into what, even to myself,
seems a strange dance.</p>

<p>"The substitute proposed is very good, nay, it is as good
and as perfect as the original, save in one single point. It
covers every ground I ever had in view, <i>save one</i>.</p>

<p>"And, who beneath the sun, can stand in the gap opposing
that?</p>

<p>"Now let me explain to you my thoughts and mental
processes.</p>

<p>"The swindlers have removed their property, <i>i. e.</i>, the
plunder, out of the State of New York. When the infamous
decision was made in the State's own court that it, <i>i. e.</i>, this
State itself, <i>had no title</i>, that judicial point was thenceforth
law in all foreign courts. If the State should bring an action
in any foreign court, such court would be bound to
decide against the plaintiff on the strength of that decree,
substantially made <i>by such plaintiff itself</i>. But when the
county or city or any like entity brought its action, the maintainability
of that action would be a judicial question, determinable
by the foreign judges according to their own
views derived by them from the general principles of jurisprudence.
These principles taught me, and should teach
them, that as to most of these fraudulent abstractions the
subordinate local entity had no title.</p>

<p>"When conferring with you concerning this subject prior
to your message I distinctly stated this consideration.</p>

<p>"Though this may seem the product of a jurisprudent's
recondite studies, it was born of practical common sense, and
what is, perhaps, more to the point of my next observation,
and to which it is preliminary, this idea is of a natur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>e to be
eminently popular. It might fairly be thought somewhat
sensational.</p>

<p>"I was amazed to miss it from the lines of your message.
If the thought that <i>you</i> could have any hesitation about pursuing
the plunderers and their plunder to the ends of the
earth presented itself to me at all&mdash;as I must suppose was
not the case&mdash;it was, of course, instantly rejected as fanciful
and silly.</p>

<p>"But now, after a long pause for thought, forth comes
the substitute for your own original conception, so long and
so faithfully nurtured and cherished by me. And what is
the difference between the original and the substitute?
Nothing whatever, except this one thing.</p>

<p>"The title to and ownership of the money or cause of
action is to remain unchanged!! Since that title was Allenized
it is <i>not</i> in the State.</p>

<p>"In all the courts of this State your substitute will be
just as good as the original. For <i>any</i> future local frauds
I do not see but it is likely to answer every purpose. The
single effect wrought by the alteration is that the stolen
funds now in 'Belgium or Brittany' will be safe for the
enjoyment of the thieves.</p>

<p>"To Dick Connolly it presents perfect immunity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps on this point you may say simply that I am
mistaken; but such a remark never convinces any one. The
mistake may exist, but the child of error never can see his
mistake until some one takes the trouble of dissecting it and
showing by adequate explanations that it is a mistake.</p>

<p>"I have done as to this substitute. No further observations
upon it seem needful.</p>

<p>"The Tweed spirit is rampant here. It is determined to
possess itself of unrestrained power over all the offices as
avenues to plunder. The local suits against Tweed <i>et al.</i>
will no doubt be pushed; but if any judgments shall be
rendered which the gang shall dislike, their friends in the
<i>Refugium Peccatorum</i>, as in duty bound, will reverse.
Meantime the Statute of Limitations will do its kindly work.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I fully intended to drop in upon
you to-day for an hour or two, but found myself this morning
without a voice, and with a sore throat and headache. I
wanted to say what I know it is unnecessary to say, but might
be cheering and strengthening to you, that in this struggle
with Tweed's scattered forces, led by the Mayor, to recover
possession of the city treasury, you will be sustained if you
are, as I am sure you will be, firm and defiant. You have
only to inspire the public with confidence that you cannot
be seduced or bullied into any concessions to the predatory
class which is 'trying it on' with you, and you will find all
of this city worth having are your friends. I am told that
the Senate is likely to squelch the Costigan bill. If so,
they will do wisely for themselves, no doubt, but they will
deprive you of an excellent opportunity in a veto message
to give Wickham his <i>coup de grace</i>.</p>

<p>"There is nothing you ever did that went so to the heart
of the New-Yorkers as the way you doubled up Tweed and
his pals. This movement against Green is the secondary
symptoms of the same disease, and offers you an opportunity
of which, I take it for granted, you will avail yourself
of strengthening the public confidence in your chieftainship.</p>

<p>"You do not need to be told that nothing would be so
fatal to you as the friendship of the Ring who are trying
to force you into their intrigues to plunder the city. Green's
defence has produced a fine effect here, and while the war
lasts his position will improve.</p>

<p>Mr. Green had not been long in the office of Comptroller,
to which he was appointed for the purpose of rendering its
records accessible to Mr. Tilden, before he had alienated
pretty much every one who had business with his department.
He doubtless supposed that that was the necessary
result of doing his duty. But such was not the impression
left upon the Governor's friends, and the following letter
from Mr. Hewitt was not the first indication of a public
sentiment which made his nomination for that office, at the
expiration of Connolly's term, which he was serving, impossible.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;You will be glad to learn that I
am getting stronger, and the doctor recommends me to go
to Washington for a few days.</p>

<p>"You may be sure that I have followed the Wickham
controversy with great interest, and was delighted at the
perfect ease with which you applied an extinguisher to his
farthing candle.</p>

<p>"If your brain keeps on softening for a few months
longer, I think you will arrive at a development which will
leave no doubt in the public mind as to your entire fitness
for a much higher position than you now fill.</p>

<p>"Power told me yesterday that Kelly would be in Albany
this week; let me urge that you have the frankest of free
talks with him. I am satisfied that he will meet your views
on every point except the retention of Green. Now you
cannot afford to let Green be slaughtered, but Green can
very well afford, in view of the momentous consequences to
you involved in a disruption of the party machinery here,
to solve the difficulty by placing his resignation in your
hands, to be used only when a successor satisfactory to you
and to Kelly can be agreed upon. I had a long talk with
Green on Sunday night. He believes his position to be impregnable,
and he is not at all conscious of the intense disgust
with which he is regarded by the Tammany organization.
He even thinks that the general committee might be
got to indorse him. I told him very frankly that in my
judgment it would be destruction to those who are really
his friends to make any such issue in the committee, and I
tell you that it is no use to try it. Your position and character
will be with me the first consideration, and after that
it seems to me that Kelly's position should be made as easy
for him as the circumstances will admit. I think he understands
Wickham now, and you and he ought never to be lacking
in a perfect understanding with each other. I have not
seen Kelly, as I would have been glad to do, but you are
at perfect liberty to show him this letter if you choose, as
there is nothing in my mind that I would not be willing to
say to him per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>sonally on these topics, if he were to think it
worth while to consult with me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ruggles has been to see me with regard to the
Davis canal bill, which he thinks is a blunder; he is quite
clear, and I agree with him, that the canal can only be
properly administered by a general superintendent, nominated
by the Governor, and approved by the Senate. The
Governor should have the power to suspend or remove the
general superintendent for cause. In this way the Governor
will have the direct control of the canal, and the canal commissioners
be relegated to their proper duties of auditing
the expenditures, and seeing that the general superintendent
does his duty.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the position in which Davis has
placed himself in regard to the Tammany delegation affords
an unusually favorable opportunity for getting this legislation.
It might be brought in as a counter-proposition to
Davis's bill. If you had a proper understanding with Davis
in advance, and he would agree to make not more than a
nominal opposition to the substitute, the canals could thus
be rescued from the corrupt ring which has plundered the
revenues for so many years. If your administration could
accomplish any such result it would be a great triumph, as
well as a priceless benefaction to the people of this State.</p>

(ON THE GOVERNOR'S POWER OF REMOVAL FROM OFFICE)</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Fort Washington</span>, <i>February 11, 1875</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I wrote you yesterday. You will have
probably seen, ere this can reach you, a partisan opinion in
the <i>Herald</i> pronouncing your authority in the matter of
removals limited to a Delphic response whether the 'reasons'
or the 'causes' are sufficient. This, too, to be pronounced
in the Mayor's specification of his reasons, without
any authority on your part to look out of it.</p>

<p>"This is unsound. Your power of approval is just like
the Mayor's power of removal&mdash;absolutely discretionary.
You are not bound to pass upon the 'causes' assigned nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the 'reasons' communicated. The grammatical import of
the law and the good sense of the thing show that your
approval is to apply to the removal, <i>i. e.</i>, the act itself.</p>

<p>"This journalist's reasoning would tie you up very
closely. If the Mayor were to remove Comptroller on the
ground that he had shown himself quite unworthy of confidence
by kicking his wife in a church on Sunday, in the face
of the whole congregation during divine service, the only
point before you would be whether such a cause&mdash;assuming
the fact to be as asserted&mdash;was in point of law sufficient
ground of removal. Though Green had no wife, was sick
in bed at home on the designated Sunday, and that, owing
to bad weather or some accidental cause, there was no
service in his church on that day, you must approve his
removal and let him be kicked out unless you were prepared
to say that, in point of law and reason, such misconduct was
not objectionable in a public officer.</p>

<p>"The truth is, the Democratic branch of the Tweed Ring
is no better than the Republican branch of the same. The
former and the latter have the same aims. Either from
weakness or something else, the Mayor goes with 'our
friends.'</p>

<p>"You must make up your mind to go with that interesting
party or to go against it. I am against it; nothing will
persuade me to withhold any little power I possess from
the anti-swindler-ism party.</p>

<p>"At the outset, Curtis and Porter were called in and gave
a written avowal of their <i>doubts whether there was any
remedy</i>. When the reform Mayor, a Republican, was coming
in, Smith was substituted for O'Gorman. Now recently,
counting in some way on favor or folly or softness
in Wickham, Smith arranged it to dismiss Peckham and
Barlow and substitute <i>Porter and Curtis</i>!! All the scamps
have fled except Tweed. Field is hurrying up Tweed's
criminal case, and the moment he gets a reversal, which is
pretty sure, Tweed will fly. No civil process of arrest being
out against him, this is easy.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The usurpation by the military arms of the
United States of the entire government of the <i>late</i> State of
Louisiana has been consummated by the forcible expulsion
of members of the Legislature from their seats by United
States soldiers.</p>

<p>"This occurrence demands, in my judgment, an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
of public opinion in relation to it more efficient than
editorial denunciations, however emphatic. The press exerts
a wonderful influence, but there are exigencies in which its
efforts to arrest abuses may be greatly strengthened by public
opinion expressed in more authentic form.</p>

<p>"In Louisiana the executive branch has for some time
past been kept in place only by soldiers under the orders
of the Commander-in-Chief of the United States armies.
The judges hold their offices by favor of the same Presidential
commander. Now he has taken possession of the only
remaining branch of the State government, the Legislature,
by direct military force. The usurpation is complete. The
State government is extinct. One State in the Union has
ceased to be. The atrocious despatch of General Sheridan,
commander at New Orleans, to the Secretary of War, illustrates
the arbitrary spirit and thirst for unlimited martial
power that inspires the orders under which he holds the
State in subjection, and exhibits in true colors himself a
willing and dangerous instrument of ambitious aspirations.</p>

<p>"Under this crisis I beg respectfully to suggest for your
consideration whether some official demonstration ought not
to be made by the government of this State&mdash;an expression
of strong reprehension and warning&mdash;in the hope that it may
aid in recalling to their proper duties those who are now
lending their official influence to the overthrow of our republican
institutions. A special message by you to the Legislature
and a prompt and energetic protest by the Assembly,
and I should hope by the Senate also, may be a timely
measure of far-reaching benefit. It seems to me that something
of this nature is demanded by the exigency, and would
be an act worthy of the chief magistrate of the State of New
York.</p>

you before you send in your message. Upon one point I am
anxious&mdash;that is the <i>canal question</i>. The constitutional
amendment, the state of the country, and the condition of
commerce makes this the leading question of the day. It
has, since you dealt with it, taken new forms and aspects.
There are some facts which may not be known to you. This
subject cannot be treated by you in your annual message in
a clear, full way. It needs a message for itself. If you
will simply give the return of last year's business, and then,
without indicating any <i>policy</i> upon <i>any point</i>, say you will
send in a special communication with regard to it, you will
be able at your own time to treat the subject in a way which
[will] interest the whole country. You can neither do
yourself nor the canals justice by speaking about them
wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>thout making a long message, which must be avoided.

<h3>CHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Fort Washington</span>, <i>February 10, 1875</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Gov. Tilden</span>,&mdash;Your favor of the 8th is this
instant received. I have never met the Mayor but once. I
then discovered that his prime object seemed to be the removal
of Green. This is the prime object of all the swindlers,
whatever political banner they sail under. Our friend
Marble is also hostile to him. <i>They</i> are determined to get
him out.</p>

<p>"I drew the impeachment of the counsel. As drawn it
contained what more prudent men than myself might pronounce
an injudicious paragraph against the appeals majority.
In a council, consisting of Marble, Burton N. Harrison,
and perhaps others, this was stricken out, and perhaps
rightly. The keystone to the arch imparting favor to Tweed
was the story of the substitution of Curtis and Porter for
Barlow and Peckham. But I had to acquiesce in omitting
that. The letters on <i>this</i> subject are in the New York papers
about 30th and 31st December.</p>

<p>"The Mayor sent to Barlow, Peckham, and myself for
our suggestions on the council's answer. Peckham's and
mine contain all that is needful on this subject. Mine, unwisely,
you will say, opens fire on the judicial majority, and
states with suitable words of characterization the Porter
and Curtis substitution. This you will probably not disapprove.</p>

<p>"To understand this branch of the case precisely you
should know a few facts. I had all my life greatly aided and
befriended this man. Bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>t this was not strange; I always
aid the needy and never strike any one willingly. He
thought me very amiable, but took good care to keep out of
my way from the moment he took office until he was accused.
Then he could scarcely believe his senses; so, near midnight,
he visited me, cried, implored, etc., etc. I gave him no
hope, and to his face condemned him, observing courtesy to
be sure in the choice of words. I commented in terms as
apt as this duty would permit, on his Porter and Curtis
affair. This will serve to account for his <i>subsequent</i> attempt
to reinstate Barlow and Peckham. No more need
be stated. I have requested Peckham to send you a copy
of his reply to Smith; a copy of mine will reach you as
soon as it can be made.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure the <i>power</i> that is bent on removing
Green will not improve the Corporation Counsel's office;
consequently, I cannot desire that the Mayor should be free
to fill it.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that the only political sentiment in
which I indulge is hostility of official thieves. This, like
my hostility to the negro war, places me almost alone. Some
degree of circumspection in my movement is therefore necessary;
and, perhaps, some little caution on the part of
political men how far they permit themselves to be seen in
my company, or to be suspected of being influenced by me,
is desirable to <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>"Hence I doubt the expediency for <i>either of us</i> of my
putting up at the Governor's mansion for a day or two.</p>

<p>"I may say very little, and will probably do very little
to testify my dissent; but I will see better reasons than have
yet been exhibited before I will in any way assent to Judge
Allen's standing as the law of the land.</p>

<p>"Were I Governor I would not assent to Smith's removal
without an assurance as to the successor. But this,
of course, should have no influence with you; for, as far as
you have indicated a choice to me, you have not named any
one who would impart to that office the needed vigor. At
least such is my belief.</p>

<p>"I am morally certain that the majority in the 'hybrid
body' will on some impalpable technicality defeat any civil
suit that can now be brought against the Ring. Nothing but
the clearing up bill now in your hands will draw their
teeth."</p>

<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>March 2d, 1875</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;The enclosed will show you how
I employ a leisure hour. Although I have not been editor
of <i>Frank Leslie's</i> since I left it after the campaign of '72
I occasionally write for it, and my articles are always published.
My feelings towards you have already been shown
in the columns of that paper, and anything I can do in the
future will be most cheerfully done.</p>

<p>"I hope and expect to see you our nominee for President
next year; and therefore, assuming the privilege of old
friendship, I give you my views on a few points, even at
the risk of appearing to offer unasked-for, and perhaps unwelcome,
advice. It was said, and I think truly, that a
President, when in office, knew less of the true state of
public opinion than any ordinary observer. Perhaps the
rule may hold good in a modified degree as to a Governor.
If so, I trust you may be an exception.</p>

<p>"I believe I reflect the opinion of a large portion of our
citizens at the present moment when I say that Mayor
Wickham is thought to be drifting in the direction of 'personal
government,' with a very strong leaning, in the distribution
of the most important places, towards his former
associates in Apollo Hall. The gentleman said to have been
fixed upon by him for Corporation Counsel, Mr. Whitney,
is entirely unknown either by the bar or the general public,
except by the fact that he ran for District Attorney on the
Jimmy O'Brien ticket. His appointment would give satisfaction
to no one but those immediately benefited by it,
while the selection of O'Conor (if he would accept it), or
Peckham, or, indeed, any well-known lawyer, would give
assurance to the public that the promises of reformed Tammany
really meant something.</p>

<p>"It is probably apparent to you that a dead set is being
made for the scalp of our old friend Green. He is undoubtedly
the most unpopular man in the city, and such a movement
would be too popular for any one but a man of nerve
to resist. As his name has been so intimately connected
with your own, your position, in case this issue is present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>ed,
would be at least embarrassing, and the result, in any event,
would be to your prejudice in subjecting your action to
criticism. It seems to me that all this might be avoided by
getting Green to resign, not as a forced measure, but as a
voluntary act, and with flying colors; and he might resume
his old place on the parks, or receive some other position
better suited to his tastes and temperament than the thankless
office of Comptroller. I say this without a particle of
hostility to Mr. Green, for whose ability I have a great respect,
and in whose honesty I have unbounded confidence.
I have no personal ends to subserve, and my suggestions
spring from a sincere desire to avoid in an honorable way
the possibility of persons who are not at heart friendly to
you forcing upon you an issue which might injure you with
the public. If you were to approve his removal, instead of
being regarded as a second Brutus, you would be accused
of yielding to the pressure of those who had designs upon
the treasury; if you declined it would be attributed to personal
friendship against the unanimous voice of your party
in this city.</p>

<p>"I trust that my remarks may not be considered intrusive.
If they are too frank, it is the fault of my nature and of
my earnest wish for your continued popularity in your present
station and for your advancement to a higher one.</p>

The press you see. The people are equally unanimous, and
I think enthusiastic. Part of this enthusiasm springs from
the expectation that you will make as thorough work of the

you do not disappoint these expectations. I have not heard
much lately about the softening of yr. brain, but there are
some inquiries for the kind of tipple you are partial to.

<p>"I dined with Bristow at Stoughton's last night. I am
told he had third term on the brain very bad. Edwards
Pierpont is talking up Bristow himself for the next Rep.

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;As a taxpayer I return my thanks
for your canal message.</p>

<p>"Many years ago that sagacious politician, the late John
D. Hammond, author of the <i>Political History of New York</i>,
remarked that whatever political parties there might be in
New York there always would be '<i>an Erie Canal party</i>.'</p>

<p>"And he was right. There always has been a canal party.
The Constitution of 1846 <i>manacled</i> the State. It declared
the canals should never be sold. The spoils would be gone.
The last constitutional convention determined also to keep
the manacles on. The Legislature had provided that of the
members of that convention thirty-two should be named
whose election should be secured, and this, too, without reference
to location. Sixteen were named by the Republican
party and sixteen were named by the Democratic party.</p>

<p>"Of this thirty-two, <i>not one</i> whose residence was south
of the Mohawk and west of the Hudson was named by
either party. There was one north of the Mohawk. With
that exception, commencing at New York and following up
to Albany and Troy, and thence on the Erie Canal to Buffalo,
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> find the location of them all, except one or two on
the lateral canals in the western parts of the State. There
has not been a high officer of the State in the same region
for, I think, the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p>"Surely, my dear Governor, there must still be a canal
party. But I see you are resolved that the stealing shall
cease. I was in the Legislature of 1869 with your brother,

been much disappointed in the vast expense that has attended
the keeping of this great highway of commerce in repair,
allow me, my dear sir, to congratulate and thank you for the
efficient and courageous method you have taken to investigate
what abuses may have existed in times past, and to put
this great industrial and commercial interest into a more
favorable if not a more honest administration.</p>

<p>"I impeach no one personally. It will be your province
to investigate the facts and personal bearings of such charges
as you have put forth in your excellent message in regard
to the administration of the canals. But the results are
obvious to every intelligent citizen, and lead to the natural
inference that the large sums appropriated, and the legislation
hitherto employed by the people of this State, to
gu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>ard, improve, and administer economically this great public
enterprise, have been intrusted to parties either ignorant
or irresponsible as to their duties in this matter.</p>

<p>"This is the present feeling of the people. And I only
express a general desire that the investigation you recommend
shall be conducted at once by a committee of intelligent
and honest men; that this investigation may lead to the
truth is the fervent desire of all good citizens. With renewed
expressions of thanks, and with great esteem,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The Committee of the Whole adopted
a resolution and recommending to the House its passage,
impowering you to appoint a commission to make the investigations.
Of this you, of course, are aware. Subsequently
a resolution was adopted directing the judiciary
committee to prepare a bill for the same object. Now, what
I wish to say is this: the friends of this move of both parties
in both Houses should be put upon their guard to see that
it is what is required. You must have the very <i>fullest
power</i> and authority. I found many warm friends of yours
in both parties in both Houses; but everything hangs on
your getting proper authority, and your friends must certainly
be most active and vigilant and <i>now</i>. The authority
must be full and broad. Each friend in both Houses ought
to be fully posted as to how to act and what to do. The
leaders in each House should be advised and most thoroughly
posted on all points. Concert of action is imperative.</p>

<p>"The shaping and passing of the bill is of the very highest
moment.</p>

<p>"It should be carefully scrutinized and drawn before its
introduction, and watched with the greatest assiduity and
fidelity.</p>

<p>"You are fighting the whole 'Prussian army'&mdash;officers,
rank, and file.</p>

be now no such thing as failure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>"I dare not think of the consequences that would follow
a failure. You are grappling with subtlety, ingenuity, adepts,
experts, dangerous, and most unscrupulous men whose life
has been spent in plundering the people, and who are most
expert in controlling and handling men.</p>

<p>"See to it that the Secretary of State don't flood the
State with ring census tokens. This will be a heavy blow
to you and the cause if he does. I make these suggestions,
fearing you might, in the excitement and pressure of the

might trust too much to yr. friends. Church is with the

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>March 30th, 1875</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Govr.</span>,&mdash;I telegraphed you yesterday requesting
that you would take no steps to fill the vacancy of the
7th district until you hear from me. You may consider this
presumptive, and if you do I shall not complain, or take exception
thereto.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the promptness with which you
responded to my appeal in behalf of Mr. McLaughlin, and
I am afraid that my anxiety in his behalf has subjected
you to humorous criticism from your enemies and an anti-partisan
press. I am, however, consoled by the fact that you
would have been more than pleased with the man. His abilities
are eminently superior to any person who fills these
places at present. As an evidence of his talent I refer you
to his description of yourself, ex-Governor, and myself at
an interview which took place at your house last January.
I did not even know that he intended to write anything,
and was not aware of it until I saw it in Marlborough paper,
M., etc. Now you will ask yourself what can be the motive.
I will answer by telling you none at all, except this th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>at I
am a lover of talent; but I assure you that this gift would
hardly influence me unless it was coupled with inflexible
integrity. He has both characteristics. Having said this
much relative to the man, I shall now speak of my impression
as to what has occurred in relation to McLaughlin's
intended appointment and what ought to be done to place
him and yourself right before an observing and critical
public.</p>

<p>"You appointed him, and when you did so there was
no vacancy. Your motive was of the best kind. You relied
entirely for your own justification on that which I
represented to you. Would it not be well to appoint him
again? This will enable him to appear well before the
public, and at the same time vindicate yourself and show
the people well-established consistency in what you originally
intended for the public good. If you think well of
this idea&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then let me suggest to you another. Mc will not accept
the place, and for the reason that he could not do so. The
County Clerk is an invalid, and is now in Florida seeking
health. His deputy has been recently appointed to the
position of 'Dept. Commissioner of Public Works.' McLaughlin
has been promoted to G.'s vacancy, and could not
in honor <i>except</i> [<i>sic</i>] any position while his superior is
abroad sick. The place of civil justice would be pecuniarily
a godsend; his moral obligations would prevent him from
<i>excepting</i> [<i>sic</i>] the place. Though, as I said before, it is
due to him that the place should be offered him in justification
of you both. This would soften the asperities of the
envious and silence the press, which is prone to contemptuous
ridicule. When he shall have resigned the position.</p>

<p>"Having said this much in favor of McLaughlin, I shall
now give you my opinion as to who should receive the appointment.
After mature consideration I have convinced
myself that it is due to Alfred T. Ackert, of your own district.
He is honest, and possesses talent enough to make
him a competent judge. The objection that would be offered
that he is not a resident of the district ought not to
have any consideration with you, and for the reason that if
the bill passes the Legislature to elect the civil justices on
a general ticket, as I think it will, the local politicians will
not have anything to say except in a general way; and if
they did object it would be but temporary.</p>

<p>"I hope you will consider Ackert in relation to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> appointment.
He has worked hard for three years in our organization,
and his duties have been exceedingly laborious,
and yet he has never complained, but willingly performed
them with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I have just received Mr. Pelton's letter, in which he
refers to the receipt of my despatch relative to Col. Vilner.
This must be a mistake. I did not send a despatch in behalf
of the above-named gentleman, and if he received one
it is a forgery. I sent one in the Stemmler's case, and no
other one. There is no doubt of this gentleman's demise
now. Perhaps you have not been aware of it. He died on
last Sunday evening.</p>

<p>"Your message on the canals has raised you very high
in the estimation of the men of all parties. <i>The wonder
is now that none previous to you had the courage to meet
the men who instigated these frauds and to show them to
public condemnation. Your predecessors were as well informed
of their existence as you; but for some reason of
their own, not very difficult to fathom, neglected their duty.</i>
These exposures will have a salutary effect, and will be the
means of correcting abuses which should have long since
been eradicated.</p>

<p>"Pursue the good work you have commenced, no matter
where the rod will fall, either on friend or foe. It is about
time that politicians should understand that they cannot
pursue their nefarious frauds under the supposition that no
harm can fall upon them on account of their political adhesion
to party.</p>

<p>"You should take some steps on the papers before you
in the case of Smith. You may depend that unless you do
there will be a general attack made on you by the papers of
the city. It is already being whispered that your recent
message was concocted to divert attention from matters connected
with this city. Smith has not been idle in circulating
the story that you are his friend and will not remove
him, notwithstanding the onslaught which you helped to
prepare against him at the beginning of the year. You have
already had these papers too long without taking action. I
beg of you to act immediately in this case. If you are not
fully convinced in the fire commissioner's case, you can
wait until you have had further time, and yet I am fully
satisfied that you have had time enough to determine the
course you ought to pursue.</p>

<h3>RESOLUTIONS IN RESPECT TO THE CANALS OF NEW YORK</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">"<span class="smcap">New York Chamber of Commerce.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>"At a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, held Thursday,
April 1st, 1875, Hon. William E. Dodge, president,
in the chair, the following resolutions offered by Hon. George
Opdyke were unanimously adopted:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That Governor Tilden, true to his honorable
record against the fraudulent Ring officials of this city, has
now placed the citizens of our whole State under lasting
obligations by his bold and masterly exposure of the enormous
frauds connected with the administration of the New
York canals.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That this Chamber, as the oldest commercial
organization of the State and the one expressly authorized
by charter to speak in the name of the entire commercial
interests, feels specially called upon to express its gratitude
to the Governor for his fearless and vigorous effort to arrest
the frauds, so discreditable to the character of our State and
so injurious to its commercial interests.</p>

<p>"His effort deserves the commendation and hearty support
of every citizen of the State.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That this special message of the Governor on
'canal frauds' is in perfect harmony with the views he
expressed in his annual message. In that document he manifested
broad and accurate knowledge in relation to the
present condition of the canals, clearly pointed out their
defects, and suggested the remedies that he deemed essential
to their increased efficiency and productiveness; and
also to the integrity and economy of their administration.
Among the remedies he suggests are a proper disposition of
the unproductive lateral canals, the securing a uniform
depth of seven feet in the waterway of the Erie Canal, and
modifications in the present plan of administering them.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That, in the judgment of the Chamber, it is
absolutely essential to the efficient management of these
canals that this department of the State government should
be under the control of a sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>gle executive head, appointed
by the Governor and Senate, and removable at the pleasure
of the Governor, with power to appoint and remove his subordinates,
and who alone should be held responsible for the
proper management of the canals. All experience goes to
prove that this is the only safe method of securing efficiency,
fidelity, and economy in the administration of public affairs.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That this Chamber will watch with deep interest
the progress of this praiseworthy effort of the Governor
to secure perfect integrity in the Canal Department,
and will aid that effort by all proper means within its power.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, duly authenticated
by the officers of the Chamber, be forwarded to his
Excellency, Governor Tilden."</p>

judgment, be subordinated to this matter if by so doing these
irregularities in canal management may be eradicated, root
and branch. I have studied your analysis of the subject,
and I believe you are on the right track.</p>

<p>"You are up to your eyes in a confusing multitude of
affairs, and may not have as clear a vision as I fancy I have
concerning affairs here.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that, as usual in such alterations,
there is a class who counted on coming into the succession
and enjoying Tweed's privileges. In his day the so-called
Democratic wire-pullers and the so-called Republican wire-pullers
understood each other and divided the spoils.</p>

<p>"This was a still existing policy at the last city election.
Wales, the Republican candidate for Mayor, was nominated
in the interest of the regular Democratic nominee,
and ran to secure the defeat of Ottendorfer, who is an independent
man, probably a very honest man and, for aught I
know or suspect, would have as truly supported integrity
and justice in government as anybody else. Accordingly,
Wales, as appeared by the papers, was a champion of Bill
Costigan.</p>

themselves or where to turn. They don't get a chance to
turn Green out, and you keep the Corporation Counsel on his

<p>"It seems to me you must stick just as you are. I have
not too much confidence in the most recently elected Democratic
judges. I am sure that if the Mayor gets the making
of a corporation counsel that office will become as bad as it
ever was. Now the incumbent stands in dread, and behaves
un-obstructively. I write to advise that you beware how
you alter this condition of things.</p>

<p>"You have gone so deeply into the hunt after scoundrelism
that I do not see how you could repent, even if you
wished to, and I presume you do not.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The bill which was introduced yesterday
by Miller, of Orange, has caused a great deal of bad
feeling here among our people. Green's connection with it
is unquestionable. It is strange that any one claiming to
be a Democrat could act so unwisely. Such acts as these
would destroy the best party organization in the country.
I am astonished that our members could act so inconsistently.
There is no apparent head in the Assembly, and in
its present disorganized state its inconsiderate acts will tend
to weaken us in the State and be the means of getting up
an outside organization to co-operate with the Republicans
next fall. Already this is being bruited about now. I had
expected that matters would proceed smoothly here in the
future, and there would have been no difficulty if discreet
judgment had been used when this fiasco shall have subsided.
I would advise that advances be made to the well-intending
members so that there may be entire unison of
action. Above all, there must not be any disintegration
among ourselves, except so far as they relate to corrupt
men, against whom we should set our faces.</p>

<p>"Your act in pardoning Ingersoll was severely commented
on at first. When your purpose was explained the
reaction was instantaneous; all now, or nearly all, commend
you for it. The traitor is at all times despised, but treason
is thought well of, and particularly so when the people have
obtained a substantial benefit, which will be, no doubt, the
result in the Ring cases through the testimony of Ingersoll.</p>

<p>"Your steady and persistent course in these Ring frauds
will immortalize yourself, O'Conor, and those who have
acted with you in the good work you have and are performing
in the interest of the people. May God spare you and
your assistants until you will have finished your tasks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Most of men would have become disheartened at the many
repulses you have met.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Governor, you must have a man in the
corporation counsel's office who will act for the interest of
the public. You cannot depend on the present incumbent
in that office. If he were to act in good faith with you
there still would be eavesdroppers about the concern who
would carry the news outside; there must be an entire regeneration
in that office to make it effective. Your time is
now to follow up the present excitement incident to the
release of Ingersoll. You will recollect how anxiously I
pressed this matter on you when in Albany last week. Let
me repeat to you again that you would be entirely safe in
the hands of Whitney. He is an honest, high-toned gentleman,
and will co-operate with you and do credit to himself.
Don't let this matter pass over Saturday.</p>

your strength will hold out to enable you to add new laurels
to your achievements.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Mr. McLean has just been here,
and from him I gather that you are anxious for speed, and
especially <i>in re</i> Sweeney.</p>

<p>"The more haste the less speed is often a true phrase.
Everything necessary and within the limits of our power
was done at once to prevent Tweed's escape on a discharge
likely to be awarded by his friends of the <i>Refugium Pec.</i>
Other proceedings, it seemed to me, should be cautiously
and deliberately initiated. I could not help seeing the
judiciary's headway against us, and that the Scovil remedies
bill, wounded and paralyzed in its birth, limps sadly. So in
whatever I do I feel the necessity of caution.</p>

<p>"I have requested Peckham and his allies to pick up the
outside biographical facts concerning Sweeney and his tribe.
How and when they went off, where they are, etc., etc.
Whilst this is progressing I stay home and <i>pump</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>"The man is very intelligent; taught by his sufferings,
he is perfectly biddable and bent upon giving entire satisfaction.
But men of his grade are bad at delivery, and need
a midwife who has much industry and inexhaustible patience.
He is in low health, constantly taking medicine,
and it was not until Friday afternoon late that I got possession
of him. The information comes forth very slowly,
but I think in the most precise form. I got everything in
the most painfully minute details; but it will not be painful
reading. On the contrary, I think it will be as amusing
as instructive. I throw it all into narrative form. It will
read like a novel; and although it is bad policy in general
to show one's hand, I am under the impression that when
I get through with him it would be a good operation to publish
his narrative.</p>

<p>"Sweeney is cunning in the extreme, and no doubt had
the concealment of his tracks in view from the beginning.
But it will surprise me if he can escape. I shall try to put
things in such a shape that we can drop suddenly upon whatever
may be here. I am told that he designed coming back
to give his skilled talent to the task of defence. Between
him and D. D. F. and the <i>Refugium Pec.</i> it might seem
that a hopeful fight could be maintained for a little while.
But there can be only one end.</p>

<p>"I think we will want an agent in Paris. I know one,
Henry Harrisse, a lawyer there, who formerly perched in
this city. Though a Frenchman by birth, he is perfectly
conversant with our language, our people, and our affairs.
I feel sure that he is honest and trustworthy. Had I not
best write to him at once? The Sweeney tribe will probably
have to be pursued to Europe. Tom Fields is there,
and probably other subjects of discipline are or will be.
Had I not best write to Harrisse at once and retain him?</p>

<p>"You must be patient, no time is being wasted.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;<i>I had lis pendens</i> filed on all the property
Tweed has owned since 1867. Some little is still in
his name. Most of it is transferred. I have complete lists
of the property of the Sweeneys and Hugh Smith, and <i>lis
pendens</i> ready to file the moment Mr. O'Conor gets the suits
ready to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw him yesterday and forwarded to you his letter,
which you received this morning, I suppose. I cannot hurry
him. He is making the case as thorough and complete as
possible. Ingersoll turns out to be all we expected, and is
perfectly ready to do what he can.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything can be lost by the few days' delay,
as a transfer just now would be so clearly for purposes
of fraud as to make it of [not?] the least benefit.</p>

<p>"I saw an article in the <i>World</i> to-day, copied from a
Syracuse paper, to the effect that the Court of Appeals had
come to a conclusion in the Tweed case and in his favor
and on the points raised by Comstock. I don't believe it
at all, but if so, it is most scandalous, as Comstock was
allowed to raise his points in reply, and we had no opportunity
to answer. There is nothing in his point as <i>habeas
corpus</i> serving, and almost as clearly none as writ of error.</p>

<p>"If the court ever decided for Tweed it ought to be d&mdash;d
eternally.</p>

<p>"It seems to me almost impossible for it to do so honestly.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Julia has asked me to send you a
copy of the contract between myself and Mr. Henderson
in regard to the rent which is to be paid by the <i>Evening
Post</i> in the new building. This is no contract, properly
speaking, but only a letter from me to Henderson, in which
our understanding respecting that matter is briefly stated.
In the letter I simply say that I turn over the building to
him, advise him to go on with it on his own account, making
it convenient for the publication of a daily newspaper, and
expressing my desire that a lease for twelve years of the
necessary rooms shall be made to the <i>Evening Post</i>, 'the
rent to be fixed by two competent and disinterested persons.'
This is all, and a copy of the letter would show nothing
more.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Our determination here is to push the
Ring suits to decision as rapidly as possible. Once we get
fairly started everything will move with the utmost rapidity.
But getting the fair start is attended with no slight
difficulty. The field is so wide and is so full of minute details,
and the sources of information are so much more
<i>responsible</i> than formerly. We must not let our deponents
make any mistakes. Their knowledge being absolute and
actual, their responsibility is great. If through haste or
want of memory mistakes occur they may be pronounced
wilful, and thus their credit be destroyed, or at least impaired.
By interlocutory motions, such as demands for
impracticable things, as copies of destroyed papers, etc.,
they will bring <i>their</i> judges down upon us, and thus precipitate
the climax.</p>

<p>"Probably this is well enough. If <i>their</i> judges have resolution
equal to their wishes they can defeat us, in despite
of any legislation. But it is to be hoped that <i>fear</i>, like the
cackling of the Roman geese, may save the State.</p>

<p>"It is said that one of our N. Y. judges has pledged
himself to save Sweeney. Very likely. And, I guess, whenever
he has a chance, the Mayor will appoint as a corporation
counsel a known friend of that absent functionary.</p>

<p>"My precise motive in writing at this time is to warn
you of the necessity of watching closely all amendments
of the Code of Procedure, and any statutes concerning practice.
There is great likelihood of an attempt to smuggle
some baffler of that sort through the Legislature.</p>

<p>"In reply I have just written you at length, and looking
at the length of the document, have destroyed it, thinking
that a long history is not what you want.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>
<p>"I had not seen the newspaper attacks or the cartoon;
did not know that Barlow had a brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"You say that I may ascribe delay to Mr. O'Conor. <i>I
do.</i> I drew and gave him complt. vs. Sweeney. I would
have prepared affidavits. He assumed the duty of so doing
himself. At his request I wrote you to pardon Ingersoll.</p>

<p>"He alone has seen Ingersoll, he proposing that it should
be so.</p>

<p>"You say he is not above being helped and aided. I
have been completely at his service from the moment he commenced
till now. He has declined all assistance, saying
that the drafting of affds., etc., was work at which but one
could work. If there has been anything other or further
that I could do or could have done I do not know it.</p>

<p>"If the matter had been under my control I shd. have
commenced suits and had attachments long before.</p>

<p>"They would have been without the perfect basis which
the results of Mr. O'Conor's long labor will disclose.</p>

<p>"It may be that such perfect basis, when disclosed, will
be well worth all the delay.</p>

<p>"Whether so or not was and is for you and the Atty.
Genl. to determine; not for me.</p>

<p>"After Mr. O'Conor assumed the labor of preparing the
case vs. Sweeney, etc., it certainly would have been highly
improper and indecorous for me to do otherwise than acquiesce.
As to my personal action, all I can say is that I
have been at his service always. That I have urged haste
as strongly as common courtesy to him would allow. You
speak of what might have been done 'if I had been really
anxious to produce results.'</p>

<p>"I am at a loss to understand your meaning.</p>

<p>"You certainly <i>cannot</i> mean what the words apparently
mean.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that there ever was <i>a doubt</i> in <i>your</i>
mind, or the mind of any man, as to whether I was 'really
anxious to produce results.'</p>

<p>"If there was you should not have employed me or suffered
me to be employed. I <i>have</i> waited for Mr. O'Conor.
Could I or should I have done otherwise? You say that
Mr. O'Conor is above criticism. Agreed. But so far as
anxiety to produce results&mdash;so far as devoting all time or
labor to the cause, so far as making this business the very
first, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i> are c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>oncerned&mdash;I
insist that I am as far above criticism as is Mr. O'Conor or
any living man.</p>

<p>"If there is or has been any delay caused by want of zeal
or attention on my part I shd. like to know it.</p>

<p>"You will note that I make no criticism on the delay in
the preparation of the affds. I have not seen them, nor do
I know what they will be. From the general description
of them, given me by Mr. O'Conor, I think they will be
well worth the delay, and when you come to know what he
has done I think you will wonder not at the delay, but at
how soon an immense work was accomplished.</p>

<p>"I only say in answer to your letter that the delay has
been beyond my control. Mr. O'Conor yesterday expressed
great confidence that he would have manuscript for me to
begin printing by to-morrow or next day, and that I shd.
have the affds. for the use to oppose Tweed's motion for a bill
of particulars June 1st.</p>

<p>"From what he has said I suppose that when ready for
our use they will be for all, and that we can commence the
other suits next week.</p>

<p>"Whether the delay was wise or not is not the question.</p>

<p>"I only say that whether wise or unwise I am not <i>responsible</i>
for it, for I had not the <i>power</i> to control it. <i>Responsibility
goes with power.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 21em;">"<span class="smcap">Wheeler H. Peckham.</span>"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"I will watch for criticisms in the papers as to pardoning,
etc., and see that any error is corrected.</p>

<p>"I rather think that the publication of the affds. Mr.
O'Conor is preparing will be the best answer that can be
made to criticisms, and I now feel quite hopeful that they
will be ready next week."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Since you, following in the wake
of the Legislature, abandoned the capital, Albany has been
extremely slow and stupid; but the constant and voluminous
gossip that has prevailed regarding the supply bill indicates
that, although absent, you are very 'numerously remembered,'
and, no doubt, prayed for. Will all the prayers be
continued after the thirty days have expired? I am not
sure, if I were near you, that I should ask you to approve the
new capitol item. As an Albanian, perhaps yes; as a citizen
of the State, possibly no; and as a Democrat, no, most
decidedly, without a change in the management.</p>

<p>"Your arguments on the canal appropriation bills are
really admirable&mdash;so strong, clear, and convincing, indicating
so much research and such thorough knowledge of
the whole intricate subject. They will be very popular, even
beyond the State; and here no voice will venture to rise in
opposition.</p>

and would do much harm if they only dared

stand under cover, make faces, and tell what they intend
to do at the next State convention; among other things,
they are then and there to annihilate the <i>Argus</i>. Our organization

</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,&mdash;You are quite correct in assuming that
no action of mine on any bill or item has been inspired by
anything but kindly disposition towards you.</p>

<p>"1. The canal extraordinary repair bill. When I found
that I must veto this I at once communicated with you,
and expressed the opinion that it would not prejudice your
position as to the $15,000. That is my opinion now. I do
not see any reason to doubt that you can pay that sum out
of ordinary repairs. Tho' as an original job it may have
been extraordinary work, when it came to be left in a condition
to interfere with the current use of the canal, the
removing of the obstruction, and putting in order the bank
of the canal, is ordinary repairs.</p>

<p>"You may get the money at once on this theory. You
could not get it under the extraordinary repair bill.</p>

<p>"2. The Hudson River improvement bill. The Comptroller
informed me that there would be no money to pay for
this object or the soldiers of 1812. The veto certainly had
no reference to the commissioners.</p>

<p>"3. The supply bill was finally disposed of on information
that had gradually been collected in the last two days
of the period allowed by the Constitution, and while I was
disabled by boils, so that I could not sit up. I should have
communicated with you about the item of $750 if there had
been time. I supposed I had sufficient and correct information
from a gentleman to whom I had referred a portion of
the supply bill for the investigation of facts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>
<p>"His report to me was that this item was in conflict&mdash;by
inadvertence, I presumed&mdash;with two clauses of the
amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<p>"Certainly I had no idea of unkindness or disrespect
towards you. I shall be happy to look into the case, and if
there is power to make this provision, to favor it.</p>

<p>"I have on several occasions manifested favorable sentiments
towards you and your brother. I mentioned him favorably
in the special canal message, and you on some recent
occasions.</p>

<p>"I gave up my judgment as to the $150,000 for the
aqueducts and 16 locks to your joint opinion and wishes.</p>

<p>"I desire to treat you with consideration, and to co-operate
with you for the public good.</p>

policy to be pursued as to the canals, in which I should be
glad to have your concurrence as far as is consistent with
your judgment.</p>

after the close of the legislative session, and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> action

my power.</p>

<p>"I am of the opinion that acts are established which
amount to causes of the nature contemplated by law, and
which would at least be sufficient to induce a private client
to change his counsel. It seems to me quite clear that a rule
at least as stringent as would govern a private client ought
to be applied for the protection of a great community besieged
by many millions of unjust and fraudulent claims,
which are prosecuted with the energy of private interests,
and which are always able to obtain great advantages over
the public in a contest of professional talent, skill, zeal,
activity, and persistence. I have, therefore, executed a certificate
of approval, which is herewith transmitted. I have
the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

<br />
"<span class="smcap">Hon. Samuel J. Tilden.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Allow me to congratulate you on the success
and popularity of your administration as Governor of
the State of New York. It seems to have the true Bentonian
and Silas Wright tone or ring in it. I like it, and
wish you the most perfect and entire success in the noble
and patriotic efforts you are making to ferret out and punish
thieves, without regard to party, and bring back the administration
of the public affairs in the State of New York
to the splendid condition they were in when confided to the
guidance and care of such men as Wright, Marcy, and others
of their best and most influential days. May God give you
health and strength to carry out your noble purposes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
utmost limit of your commendable aspirations.</p>

<p>"I rejoice to hear of the signal defeat of the Democratic
party of Ohio on their shameful inflation platform; and I
am prayerfully hopeful that a similar result may accrue to
the silly, not to say dishonest, inflationists of Pennsylvania.
However much it may be regretted that the foolish inflationists
of the Democratic party should have had sufficient
influence to insure its defeat this fall in those two States,
it will have the good effect to tumble out of the Presidential
path several aspirants and possible candidates for that high
office.</p>

<p>"The Democrats in the United States have once more
the political cards in their own hands, and they are mostly
trumps. Two-thirds, I may venture to say, of the Republican
party, are wearied, not to say disgusted, with Grant's
administration and sigh for a change, which would have
been affected at the last Presidential election but for the
inconceivable folly of the Democratic party in nominating
Greeley, who for forty years had exerted himself to the
utmost of his ability to destroy the party and malign and
blacken the character of the most pure-minded and patriotic
members of it.</p>

<p>"'Free trade, reform, and speedy return to specie payments'
should be the conspicuous rallying or watchwords
of the Democratic party in the future; and it must follow,
as the night the day, that, with that insignia inscribed upon
its banners, and with candidates truly representing the sentiment
or policy it indicates, the party will next year triumphantly
sweep the country from one extremity to the
other.</p>

<p>"Protective duties, Civil War, and excessive issues of
paper money have done much to demoralize the character
of our people and waft the country towards the brink of
ruin! It is high time to bring these destructive measures
to an end; and to the Democratic party, rightly directed,
is reserved the noble and patriotic mission of effecting this
incalculable benefit to the United States, which would bring
back the party itself to the enjoyment of all of its pristine
power and the warm affection of an overwhelming majority
of the people.</p>

<p>"The war is happily at an end, and protective duties
may be abolished by repealing the ruinous acts that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>authorize
their unjust exactions. But a return to specie payments
cannot be effected by simply passing resolutions or empty
and vague enactments of Congress. Something more grave
and important is required to insure this great and much-needed
reform in the deplorable financial condition of the
country.</p>

<p>"In an extremity, and as a <i>war measure</i>, the government,
having undertaken to furnish a paper currency declared to
be equal in value to gold; and having made that currency
the basis of a system of banking, which has been generally
adopted throughout the country, it cannot now withdraw
itself from the full responsibility of that position without
great detriment to the best interests of the country, and incurring
lasting dishonor, until it shall have, as it is abundantly
able to do, appreciated that currency and brought it
up to par in gold. This being done, the government will
have returned to specie payments; and greenbacks, being
the basis of banking, the banks themselves will also have
resumed specie payments, if in a solvent condition, with an
augmented appreciation of the whole volume of the currency,
including the greenbacks and the bills of the national
banks equal to the difference between the current value of
the depreciated currency and the price of gold in the American
market, which I perceive by the last quotations is 16
per cent. This <i>agio</i> or premium, calculated on the whole
amount of paper currency now issued by the national banks
and the government (equal, I suppose, to no less than
$700,000,000), would amount to $112,000,000; and this
large sum is simply what would, in that event, justly accrue
to the possessors or holders of the depreciated currency of
the government and the national banks.</p>

<p>"How, it may be asked, can this desirable result be
<i>easily</i> attained? Evidently in no other way than by the
government taking such steps and adopting such measures
as will surely bring into its possession an amount of gold
sufficient to enable it to deal in its own currency for <i>all</i>
government transactions. How is this to be done? Simply
by a six-per-cent. 'redemption loan,' having 30 years to
run, and to an amount equal to the full volume of the greenback
currency now afloat. I say <i>six per cent.</i> because I
would make the absorption of the loan <i>speedy</i> and <i>sure</i>,
though it is not unlikely that a loan of the kind might be
slowly negotiated at 5 or even 4&frac12; per cent. interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>. But
a government loan at 6 per cent., having thirty or even
<i>twenty</i> years to run, would be caught up with avidity by
capitalists on both sides of the Atlantic at a large premium;
and it would at once throw the balance of trade in favor
of the United States, so that there would be no immediate
demand for gold abroad. It would, also, break down at once
the mischievous ring speculations in gold at home, and obviate
the necessity of buying gold for the payment of customs;
and as gold could be obtained at any time for greenbacks
or the bills of specie-paying banks, the demand for it
would become so small that gold, instead of commanding,
as it does at present, a ruinously high premium, would most
likely become a drug!</p>

<p>"Such a loan as I have indicated should be put upon the
principal money markets of the United States and in Europe
and bid for simultaneously, and <i>payable</i> in <i>gold</i>.</p>

<p>"Should such a condition of monetary affairs be attained
the government might withdraw the greenbacks from circulation,
so fast as the volume of currency necessary to meet
the requirements of commerce should be supplied by sound
specie-paying banks, until the whole amount ($400,000,000)
shall have been retired, without disturbing materially the
general current of trade or adding a single dollar to the
present indebtedness of the United States. The interest
on the new loan would, of course, have to be provided for;
but that would be more than compensated by the saving of
gold premium, now annually required in payments for
foreign importations, which, whatever may be the amount,
is added to the price or cost of all foreign commodities consumed
by the people of the United States. The loan, moreover,
would doubtless be taken at a premium of 10 to 15
per cent.; if so, $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 would be realized
by the government by the operation.</p>

<p>"The glory of this great and patriotic achievement may
be made to redound to the honor of the Democratic party
is aroused to a proper sense of justice, and stimulated to a
faithful performance of its obvious duty to the country;
and, above all, inspired with a firm determination to be true
to its own self.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">No. 2. Aggregate Capital.</span></h4>

<p>"<i>United States.</i>&mdash;The valuation of the property of the
U. S. by the census of 1870 was (in currency) $30,068,000,000.
The returned assessed valuation for the same year
was less than one-half, or $14,178,000,000. The census
counted as property, both property and the evidence of debt
secured on such property. I do not think the productive
capital of the United States in excess of $25,000,000,000.</p>

<p>"<i>Great Britain.</i>&mdash;Baxter, in 1867-8, estimated, from accepted
data, the aggregate value of the real and personal
property of the United Kingdom at 6,000,000,000 <i>pounds</i>,
or 30,000,000,000 dollars. I should put it for 1872 as high
as <i>seven</i>, possibly <i>eight</i>, thousand million pounds.</p>

<p>"<i>France.</i>&mdash;I know of no estimate of the aggregate value
of property in France. I find several recent French writers,
who incidentally refer to it, as less than that of Great
Britain.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">No. 3 and 5. Annual Gross and Net Income on
Savings.</span></h4>

<p>"Baxter estimates, for 1867-8, the annual gross income
of the United Kingdom as 814,000,000, or $4,070,000,000;
and the <i>net</i> at about 600,000,000, or $3,000,000,000. This
last constitutes the fund out of which the nation feeds and
clothes itself, pays taxes, and repairs and saves. I should
estimate the gross income of Great Britain for 1872-4 at
full 1,000,000,000, and the net at 800,000,000. There
are no reliable data for estimating annual savings, constituting
new capital. <i>Ten</i> per cent., which is a high estimate,
in my judgment, would give 80,000,000, or $400,000,000;
and yet these figures are not consistent with the recent returns
of the Board of Trade, respecting the income from
British foreign investments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>France.</i>&mdash;Victor Bonnet asserts that the data are certain
that France before the war of 1870 saved annually as
much as $400,000,000&mdash;2,000,000,000 francs; and thinks
that the present saving is about $600,000,000. He quotes
Sir Robert Peel, approvingly, to the effect that France, with
equal revenues, saves more than Great Britain.</p>

<p>"<i>United States.</i>&mdash;Greater natural resources here give a
greater gross and net income, with equal labor. I am inclined
to put our gross income between $6 and $7,000,000,000.
I do not believe our annual saving, in prosperous
years, in excess of <i>five</i> per cent., or from $300 to $400,000,000.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">4. Annual Income from Foreign Investments.</span></h4>

<p>"<i>Great Britain.</i>&mdash;A late number of the London <i>Economist</i>
puts 80,000,000, or $400,000,000, as the minimum
paid Great Britain by foreign countries for interest on
capital invested abroad, and <i>for freights and commissions</i>.
The last year, I should think, represented full <i>one-third</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>France.</i>&mdash;The estimate of revenue derived by France
from industrial enterprises in foreign countries and foreign
loans, from 1873-4, is about 260,000,000 francs, $52,000,000.</p>

<p>"<i>United States.</i>&mdash;Nothing.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">5. Annual Outgo to pay Interest on Foreign
Debts.</span></h4>

<p>"<i>Great Britain.</i>&mdash;Nothing.</p>

<p>"<i>France.</i>&mdash;An inconsiderable amount, probably not in
excess of 12 to 15 millions of dollars.</p>

<p>"<i>United States.</i>&mdash;Not less than <i>one hundred millions</i> of
dollars. Probably more than less.</p>
